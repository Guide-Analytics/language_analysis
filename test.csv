60727604f85d750870550764,"Rushed onboarding, brusk customer support, confusion around pricing, but platform works",SG,"I reviewed the myriad choices for 3rd party fulfillment direct to customer. After extensive analysis of price and reviews, I landed on ShipHero. I was attracted to the idea of zone-less postage pricing, and found the company voice to be clear and concise. I reached out and started a conversation with their sales team.

The sales agent was clear but curt. I did appreciate that they did not attempt to follow up with me when I delayed for a significant period. When I did eventually confirm that I was moving forward, we scheduled a call for sales onboarding. This call was entirely too rushed, I could barely follow what the agent was talking about as we walked through the product user interface, which isn't a great feeling after you've finally pulled the trigger after careful and thorough research.

Following this, I was handed off to a customer support representative dedicated to onboarding. This person was definitely less curt, but she failed to correctly enter the type of packaging that I wanted to use for my product. And the web app has limited ability to enter certain information about your product, including what kind of package you want to use. That's something I'd love to have control over, I definitely don't want to be reaching out to customer support when something like that changes. As a result, a heavier package was used, and the shipping cost increased. Once you finish your onboarding with ShipHero, you can only contact customer support through the chat widget within the app. So I began communicating with the to fix the problem.

My experience with in-app customer support has been so-so. They say 20 minute average response time, but I've experiencing nothing shorter than 24 hour responses (it may not help that I'm in a timezone outside of the US). My interactions with these support agents have also been quite curt, though they did eventually solve the problem. However, the pricing on the ShipHero website is not clear when your unit weight is around 1lb. Apparently anything from 15oz to 16oz is rounded up to a pound, which I could not find clear language around on the pricing page. So now I'm paying more than I initially calculated for shipping, which was part of the reason why I chose ShipHero.

All that aside, my experience with sending inventory is so far smooth. And the product is going out to customers as expected. In reality, this is the most important part of their business, so I do appreciate that things are working correctly. But my interactions with customer support have definitely left much to be desired. I hope that as time moves forward, my impression will continue to improve. It's just a bit of a shame that my first impression is a bit murky.",2021-04-11T04:07:32.000Z,3,0,Jordan,2.0,2021-05-28 12:49:08.954908,2021-05-28 12:49:09.135818

***UPDATE***

Unfortunately, I have to knock down three stars after a few months since I found several issues with the fulfillment process.

First, if you work with Shopify and you intend to sell part of your catalog using Ship hero, bear in mind that the app will display ALL store products and orders. For example, if you have 500 SKUS and use Shiphero to sell 60, the panel will display all store orders (mixed inventories), making it extremely difficult to track orders. The filters won't work as intended in my case. The engineers suggested deleting all non Shiphero products manually within the app, which is pointless since they sync daily repeatedly, and it is very time-consuming to delete products daily.

Secondly, the packaging rules were set wrongly. Instead of using our custom packages, we had dozens of orders shipped using Shiphero packaging, which increased the shipping cost substantially, losing profit from these orders. No compensation was offered but an apology. Thank God we checked the invoices and found out.

Finally, the eventual mistakes will happen (not shipping an order in time due to operator error), which is okay, but you will need to eat up the cost or customers' negative feedback. There is no responsibility on Shiphero's end at all.

I have to say that the support is still fast and reliable. I just wished I knew all of this in advance before sending our products here.",2021-05-03T11:46:25.000Z,6,0,Francisco V,2.0,2021-05-28 12:50:58.822346,2021-05-28 12:50:59.120462

5f2591d21a5a6907a47870a1,EXCELLENT! Best business decision i've made- Thank you Ship Hero,CA,"The infrastructure built and customer support for ShipHero is unlike anything i've ever experienced with a company before. Clara is an absolute sweetheart and lifesaver! Being someone with lacking technical skills, she explained things easily and clearly to me, and helped me every step of the way with all my questions. Everyone at this company cares about you and your success for running an efficient business.

Andrea who helped with the on-boarding process was so informative and excellent at addressing all my questions as well.

I am IN LOVE with this company, and after comparing many other 3PL companies - ShipHero is the absolute best. Free storage for 60 days, very competitive and transparent pricing , fast and easy fulfillment, top notch customer service chat when you need help. I am beyond thrilled that I came across ShipHero. It leaves all other 3PL's in the dust!
No wonder they are expanding so quickly.

He has been very helpful from beginning to end and this is a nice shipping software/system. However, I do need to state, the support so far has been TERRIBLE. There are a couple support reps that are very helpful, but the majority of the time you won't reach them. Most of the time we receive either partial answers or no answers at all for days on end, even when stated issue is urgent.

Emailing takes too long because they rarely understand the issue at hand in the initial email. This leads to multiple emails of explanation when the issue needs to be resolved faster.

So then we started shipping 2 or 3 day mail from these nearby locations. The price was nearly double what we pay now. Double! So they lure you in with cheap super slow shipping and cash in on the faster stuff.
And having multiple locations is an inventory nightmare.

Where they can improve would be to decrease their lead time for B2B orders.

5fc9f6e75e693f07049f633e,Lack of transparency. Not an honest company to work with.,US,"I wanted to do a test run with them so I sent them a few boxes of items (1/4 of a pallet, stationery products). After a month, our warehousing fees were around $2200. After trying to figure out with them how it got there, a month had gone by and it currently stands at $3700.

If you're wondering how it got that high, it's because they store your items based on how they can profit as much as they can from you. Keep in mind my products are stationery/office supplies, so you have stickers, tapes, notebooks, pens, etc. Storing them myself, I would've used 1-2 standard shelf space (items unpacked, obviously).

So where are they storing my items? They are being kept in 339 bins, 2 shelves, and 1 pallet. At the time of writing, bins are $5 each, shelves $10 each, and pallets $40. That's a total of about $1750 per month. How the flying dutchman do you store 1/4 pallet of things in all those places?

If you read their support pages, it says their staff are trained to store in a way that would be as efficient as possible to save the customer money. False. They are trained to do the opposite.

You cannot request them to store your items in a certain way either, so it means that they decide how much to charge you on warehousing. How convenient.

All in all, I only lost a few hundred dollars and some time. I'm here thinking maybe working with any other reputable fulfilment centers would've been better.

Despite what others have said here on the reviews, I went ahead and tried anyway. Turns out it's just as bad as they say. If you value your time, look elsewhere.",2020-12-04T08:44:23.000Z,1,3,Aki,1.0,2021-05-28 13:15:22.575368,2021-05-28 13:15:26.921262

With me, Shipbob never made a single delivery on schedule this past year. I can understand that given the state of delays with this pandemic, but what I can't excuse is this: Shipbob was routinely over-reporting the amount of storage space required to warehouse my inventory, in order to charge me higher for storage costs.

When I cleared out my inventory to use another 3PL service, I decided to dispose of the inventory, and they charged me more on disposal than it would have cost me to ship my inventory internationally. Seriously deceptive stuff.

I spoke to a rep who I assume was higher up in the chain, he said that this may be possible but would need to reach out to his team and would confirm within a week. Several weeks have now passed and I realize that Shipbob does not care about smaller businesses. Within these weeks I have followed up again via email with no response, as well as called and was met with a robot that said partners on the growth plan do not get any call support whatsoever.

Their own employees tell us that they aren't even surprised any longer at the incompetence and issues at this company. They tell us they know about all the issues and that they don't have answers. I feel bad for them.

I won't even get into how much they overcharge small businesses on things like return shipping labels. If you are looking for a fulfillment center DO NOT use ShipBob. They will ruin your business. Look at all of the reviews.

5f4bdf0702e8570814fc3090,"shipbob stole my inventory, and held on to the rest for over 2 weeks when I wanted to remove it from their warehouse.",US,"I’ve finally received my inventory and they basically dumped my products in a box with broken edges and a strip of tape. Some of the inventory is made of paper and now damaged! I didn’t think my experience could get any lower with shipbob but here we are.

Here’s snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect:

- Firstly, if I did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center, shipbob would’ve stopped my business for an entire month!
- shipbob stole some of my inventory. They claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesn’t know how to count. Not kidding! They said that sometimes they just count incorrectly. This was during a recorded call on August 14, 2020 (mentioning dates cause they love to contact Trustpilot denying their incompetence).
- I requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless they’ve handled it, I doubt that is gonna happen.
- I asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because I absolutely no longer trust them. They denied the request. I was correct.
- Hidden fees! They told me kitting would cost $1.10 per item and charged me $2.50 without informing me of the cost change. When I asked about this - no response! (email from August 21, 2020)
- Customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss.
- Your emails will be ignored.
- Your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up. They won’t.
- You will spend many, many, many hours calling and emailing, asking people to do their job.
- Your orders will not be sent out on time.
- Your kitting will never be ready on time.
- I was going to do a pre-order sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 (F I V E) orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship FIVE orders.
- When I brought up how awful their service is I was told that, “as we work with over 4,000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time”. ( email from Aug 14, 2020) Sooo am I automatically just part of the ‘whatever, this happens group’!?!? Will YOU be part of that group?
- You have to pay $500 for an “implementation specialist” who will respond (maybe/if they feel like it) days later with no solution to your problem because they are ‘busy with [more important] back to back meetings' (email from Aug 3, 2020).
- Do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management’, it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call. They will do nothing.
- “Management” only shows up/is available for a call when you’ve voiced that you’re leaving the company.
- Once you speak with “management” you’ll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency.
- “Management” will have a call with you, and then ghost you. Literally never talk to you again.
- When I directly called them a scam (which they are) they informed me that one of their clients is Tom Brady (Instagram DM August 25, 2020). Still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me. Tom Brady...el-oh-el.
- Their 5-star reviews are clearly fake. They deleted mine and other negative comments on Instagram and have disabled reviews on Facebook (I reposted my IG comment). On Trustpilot, they always seem to receive sparkling 'reviews' right after an authentic negative review. And they’re constantly reporting reviews for ‘breaching guidelines’
Maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldn’t have to spend time making up and disputing reviews.

shipbob is a scam. Avoid.

***Do your research!***
- Read the real reviews not the bots.
- Read the real blog posts not the paid media articles.
- Read the comments that they keep deleting on their social media accounts.
- Reach out to others who have used shipbob and predictably no longer do.
- Do not be fooled by reports of growth and investors pouring money into the company.

Anyway, if you choose to still proceed, good luck, it will absolutely not end well.",2020-08-30T17:16:55.000Z,1,2,MM,1.0,2021-05-28 13:17:10.282230,2021-05-28 13:17:11.992432

5f28a8a81a5a690a041edeb8,Their glowing reviews are a complete sham.,US,"I was holding off on leaving a review until my inventory returned to me in full and I got the $2k+ refund from their shipping mistake on my account, but now they missed their SLA, again, and I have no idea when I'm getting my inventory back, so here goes.

I had a previously bad experience with a 3PL, so I felt a bit hesitant to sign up for ShipBob. Wow do I wish I'd listened to my gut. I have been lied to every step of the way. Emails to them go 24+ hours with no response.

Their dimensional pricing sounds fine, until you realize they do not care at all about what size box they use. We have a small item (<.1 cu ft) that can fit into a 7x7x3 box. Their team was putting it into HUGE boxes, and charging us dimensional pricing on their error. This is the difference between a ~$5 shipping charge and a $32 shipping charge. Now multiply that over hundreds of similar errors and suddenly our bill was out of control within the first two weeks. They've said ""we're definitely going to be refunding the difference"" but I still haven't seen a dime.

They claim that their SLAs got pushed back due to covid but ""99% are still fulfilled on time"". I have had may the inverse, 1% filled on time. Most are late to be fulfilled, late to deliver, and often ""reset"" their SLA with no reason given and nothing you can do to ask ""why""?

I have spoken to so many former customers that have had the same exact experience I have, and I can't understand how I didn't see it before I signed up. Their glowing reviews are a complete sham, and I didn't think I could have a worse experience than I did with my former company; ShipBob proved me wrong.",2020-08-04T00:15:36.000Z,1,2,J G,1.0,2021-05-28 13:17:36.849154,2021-05-28 13:17:38.262293

Customer response times have gone from a few hours to one-three business days. Even when you get a response, it rarely gives you a way forward. Check-in emails asking about the same issue a few days in a row are now just being ignored.

Also, don't be fooled by SLAs. Lately, ShipBob has started creating Warehouse Receiving Tickets on our company's behalf moving incoming stock from an earlier ticket to a later one to comply with their 6 business day processing SLAs. Our latest shipments are 10 business days into processing with no news, but they are still marked as Green/within the SLA, because new ticket means new deadlines.

Because they contract out of a fulfillment center in Tampa (which by the way, no one told me - I had to Google the Tampa address), my weights will be incorrect for weeks because the communication between the companies is brutal.

If you think rental car agencies are the best at hiding extra fees, you've never used ShipBob.

Ask a few other companies who use (or more likely used to use them) before you use them. Our experience was terrible and I feel cheated.

Their SLAs are sneaky and borderline deceitful compared to their sales pitch. You think they'll receive your inventory in at most 5 days because thats what they said? FALSE. They word it as such: ""5 business days once the WRO moved to ""Arrived"" status""

Guess who defines ""arrived""? That's right - ShipBob! Doesn't matter when it physically arrives, they are the ultimate word here. Its all in their writing so I guess I'm to blame, but never have I seen a spoken pitch differ so much from whats in a contract. Shameful, if you ask me.

That said, dont you dare mess up anything, they will charge you for it, and fail to properly notify you. $50 a day for improperly labeled arriving inventory yet not a single call or specific email!?

Shipbob is a hidden fee company parading as a 3PL.

If you dont believe me - try contacting them via phone. THERES NO NUMBER ON THEIR SITE - or at least I couldn't find one.

I have integrated it with ShipBob which handles all my fulfillment services. ShipBob is super robust, flawless and seamlessly integrated with Shopify's order fulfillment system. This has saved me a lot of time and headache.

Shipbob has introduced a new analytics tool that allows you to get proactive and manage your customer's expectations. I can also plan my inventory better using this tool. Here is the cool feature that I liked the most: As the orders increase and more data comes through, I can play around, switch on and off different warehouses and see the projected shipping rates and average shipping times. So why is this important? Because now I can figure out what warehouses should I send my product to in order to get the best saving in terms of shipping rates and the best customer experience in terms of average shipping time.

Shipbob's founder Dhruv Saxena is pretty engaged and reached out to me when I was having trouble. He helped me sort out my issues successfully.

2) Shipping prices twice more expensive than we had before so our customers end up paying more for poorer service.

5ebea35a25e5d20a88968b8c,Would give 0 stars if I could,US,"If you are looking for a fulfillment partner, ShipBob is a horrible option. In our experience... They lied about their rates and technological capabilities. They fought with us when we brought issues to their attention. Their failures resulted in hours and hours and hours of our time being devoted to something we thought we were outsourcing. Worst of all, we lost customers due to delayed orders and faulty tech related to shipping options.

We had significant issues with ShipBob since we very first began working with them, and every time one issue was solved, another occurred. Below are the issues we encountered, and based on other reviews and of their own admission, I know we are not the only company to face issues like these.

Fulfillment Center Issues:
- It is not uncommon for their fulfillment centers to sit on orders, causing delays, and then falsely claim such delays are carrier-related. This is true for regular ground orders in addition to expedited orders, and we lost several customers who paid for 2 day, 3 day, and overnight orders that were late because ShipBob delayed processing them. I should note that all orders I'm referring to met ShipBob's order import cutoff time deadlines.

- They unilaterally increased our box sizes without letting us know, which increased the cost of postage significantly. Our product fit in smaller, standard boxes they already had in stock. It was never explained why they made those changes. They eventually returned to the smaller box sizes and reimbursed us for the overcharges, but it was a major headache that took weeks to resolve.

- On more than one occasion, ShipBob sent our customers products from a different company who also used them for fulfillment, instead of sending our customers our products, which they ordered. I have no idea what happened to our inventory or whether they notified these other companies of this issue.

- It took them 6 weeks to process returns, and that is not an exaggeration. Meaning, if an item is returned to the FC, they notified us 6 weeks later that it was returned. Apparently they only decided to put a returns policy in place in Mid-March of this year, 6 years after opening their doors as a company.

Technology and Rate Issues:
- They bait-and-switched us on affordable 2 Day shipping. It took getting one of the company's founders involved for them to fulfill the promises they made, and contracted for, regarding giving our customers access to affordable 2 Day shipping.

- They consistently overcharged us for fulfillment, requiring us to do several audits and request credits for being overcharged. These exercises took hours and involved a lot of back-and-forth each time. In some cases, it wasn't until we threatened legal action that they credited us for these overcharges. Overall, we were credited several thousand dollars for overcharges, which is not insignificant.

- They offered us ""real time rates"" for overnight orders that were not actually tied to real time rates; it was a complete misnomer and false promise. This resulted in us under-charging customers and having to cover the difference, which turned profitable sales into losses.

- For a reason they still cannot explain, they removed all shipping options and rules, and instead put in place a $20 ground option (our product retails for $39.95 and weighs 6 ounces). Our conversion rate plummeted from 4.6% to 1.3% during the time that our shipping options were affected. We were not the only customer affected by this issue, and because ShipBob never got to the bottom of why it happened, they could not assure us it wouldn't happen again.

Issues Cancelling:
In the end, Shipbob reimbursed us for a lot, but not everything, and it took nearly 2 months for them to get us our final refund. When we expressed our desire to leave, their SVP of something set up a call, presumably to try and retain us, but then she missed our call and didn't reschedule.",2020-05-15T14:12:42.000Z,1,1,Rachel Kaplan,1.0,2021-05-28 13:21:00.664457,2021-05-28 13:21:00.980319

It was next-to-impossible to find out what my shipment cost for a particular order was without combining data from up to four(!) spreadsheets that they'd mail me every week and waiting two weeks for the data to get to me. Yikes! By the time we found problems, it was too late to get things corrected without losing two weeks.

So we decided to change our D2C fulfillment to ShipBob. We got set up in a short period, were trained on the software, and had our hands held by a customer support rep for the first 30 days. Boy was that nice. And we could immediately see what a shipped order cost. We made some additional tweaks with that data in hand and never looked back.

I have compiled all of the orders with incorrect postage and they refuse to make any refund to my account. They have recredited my account once for $22.

The account manager that signed my business up will not respond to any emails of which I have now sent 5 and since signing up my business to shipBob has shown no care or attention to the numerous issues I have incounterd with the business and instead I am left having to email a generic customer service account.

As a customer I understand that sometimes mistakes are made but my frustration is how the issues I have faced have been handled.

I’ve been with shipbob since they started. They simply grew too fast for their own good. I used to mostly ship out of their NY warehouse, but they lost probably at least 100 of my shipments, it started out as 1-2 lost packages a month. They were insured, but still. Last summer is where I started to lose it, literally and figuratively. They “misplaced” on the at least 2000-3000 thousand dollars worth of shipments in 6 weeks. Customer service was VERY unhelpful, they responded slowly each time I referenced the other 10 open tickets I had (they lost maybe 10 packages in 6 weeks), they always gave the same unhelpful, I didn't bother reading your email rote response. I was actually on a 3 week camping trip during most of this time and it was very stressful instead of being relaxing. One of my most popular products has been ""misplaced"" or flat out stolen from their warehouses. In this coronavirus day and age of lockdown, it's an exercise from home trainer. I just had 10 HUGE boxes of 10 shipped and signed for at their Bethlehem warehouse. The person who signed for it ""no longer works there"" All of a sudden in early March I got an out of stock notice and had sold 50 since Jan. I contacted support, and they didn't even bother replying saying that warehouse replied, saying ""they couldn't be found."" I paid over $800 to ship to shipbob and they are only reimbursing me for the cost of the items, but NOT the shipping. I implored both support and the higher up manager. The manager who reassured me so much during last's year's fiasco of lost shipments said I could contact him personally. He has also been now basically ignoring my emails and saying ""please contact support."" Thanks for nothing! To top it off, what would've been at least 2-3 months of high demand item is now out of stock for 4-5 weeks because that's how long it takes for new ones to be produced. Btw, shipbob's new reimbursement ""policy"" is to no longer reimburse for shipping when they lose an item. What happens is this, if they ship an item - it gets ""handed"" off to the carrier, but tracking never gets updated. You call the carrier and they say they never received it. Again, this used to happen once a month, but last summer it happened 10 times or more in 6 weeks - clearly things were getting stolen. So after that, I noticed the new ""policy"" not to reimburse for shipping YOU paid for, when shipbob clearly wraps up your product, charges you for it and someone steals it or throws it in the garbage.

5e6273153c93ae0bc4115083,I've waited before reviewing ShipBob,DE,"I've waited before reviewing ShipBob, as I think it's a great concept, but the last experience with them has really drawn the line.

We sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their Texas warehouse to test the ShipBob service, in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there. We currently have 2 warehouses in Europe, which we manage ourselves, and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment.

Now, before you get on, ShipBob says that the ""negotiated the best shipping rates so that you don't have to worry about it"". This sounds great, and honnestly, we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment, however, it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all...

Our product is a medium-sized table lamp, packed in a parcel with the following dimensions: 20""x20""x20"", the products are all packed and ready to be shipped, absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item!

Now, the average fulfillment cost inside the US for these items is $150 per box! $150!!!???

However, the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in Texas, to a customer in Dallas, Texas. (This is a 4h driver from the warehouse). The shipping had been done with economy, ground shipping, and ShipBob charged us $80.63 for it! Now, for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates, how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it??

Just to give you an example: We send out chairs from our European warehouses to customers in Europe, these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp. A standard shipping fee for this, from Berlin to Spain is around 18€!!! Note that Berlin to Spain is a 24h drive...

But the reason why I am now writing this review is that we just had our first return. The fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $137,9, and now Shipbob charged us $93,6 for the return of this lamp!

That's a total of $231,5 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp!!!!

How on earth???

In our own warehouses in Europe, we have a flat return rate of 8€ small/medium items and 12€ for larger items, and I am sure that it's the same in the US, and am fairly convinced that it's even cheaper, as everything stays in the same country... But $93,6 for a single return of a medium-sized parcel???


I really didn't want to write this review, this is completely absurd... ShipBob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item, and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it...

There are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates, they charge over X10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is...

Just do the math for yourself, try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20""x20""x20"" and try to get it shipped from one city in Texas to another city in the same state, and then try to see how much shipping costs...

Or try to send the same 20""x20""x20"" parcel from Texas to NY including a return label, and try to justify the $231,5 charge!


Update: I thought it would be very interesting to add the following: Our offices are located in Berlin, Germany, and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices.

Shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that I mentioned in the review, costs us about $130 with the express, door to door, air shipping, from CHINA!

How on earth is it possible that Shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the US then express air shipping from China to Germany????

New update: This keeps on getting better! Shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client, and it arrived severely damaged! (Shipping cost from Texas to NY: $140), their response to this is that Shipbob ""does not take any responsibility for the damages"". WHAT?? For $140, there is no insurance included? And Shipbob, does not take any responsibility for damages? This means that we now need to return this lamp to Shipbob, for which they will charge us another $90!!!?? This is just the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with, and I am looking forward to our stock being over with them!

I wanted to protect my business by diversifying the income stream and use an additional sales channel. I searched high and low to find a company that could meet my needs of fulfilment. Boom- I found it- ShipBob!
Now having used ShipBob for 3 months, I can honestly say that they are simply incredible. Their customer service is exceptional and I feel my business is in great hands. The people of ShipBob are one of its greatest assets.
Secondly, the platform is so easy to use. You'll find it much easier than FBA if you've ever used that platform.

5de5c81cc8454509583d7116,I had used Shipbob for 3 years,AU,"I had used Shipbob for 3 years, and suffered far too long.

Initially they were ok to get my account going, but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent.

My company sells simple ecommerce products, often in multi-packs. Their TOTAL INABILITY to simply pack a 2-unit or 3-unit multi-pack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering.

I would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation, and it took hours before I even received a call back. And then ""that"" call was from a warehouse not involved in this order.

They routinely overcharge; orders are placed into OVERLY excessive packaging for one order, then into different ""appropriate"" packaging for the next, exact same order. At times I have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $5-6. This happened as often as not.

The web-interface is clunky and buggy.

Only just now has a ""merchant care"" telephone number been setup. It's hit or miss as to whether someone answers.

Emails requesting help, particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered, or if answered, then unresolved. Typical answer - That order was too long ago, we did an audit, but unfortunately we cannot refund your money.""

And then there is this doozy - Overcharging $1400, yes! USD $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money.

""We'll credit your account"" - they say. I don't want a credit, I want that money refunded. You don't keep 'my' money ahead of time. Shipbob messed up, Shipbob should refund. IMMEDIATELY.

""We are unable to refund your credit card"" they say (they are very quick to charge your credit card, but to say they can't reverse a charge - I smell BS.

""We'll look into this and get onto it as soon as possible"" - still 2-3 weeks later and NOT.ONE.WORD on refunding me my money.

This will have to be resolved through local police fraud department I believe.

SHIPBOB are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3-year loyal existing customer.
Happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so.
Reluctant to refund that money.

Flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs. This is theft.

Everyone, please, AT ALL COST - STAY AWAY FROM SHIPBOB.

Just.Stay.Away.

Shipbob simply are THAT bad.

UPDATE: It appears that any negative review of Shipbob is attempted to be taken down off Trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine. Trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with Shipbob. A number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother, which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing.

I took the time and submitted the info requested. I felt it necessary to warn others.

As you’ll see all the negative reviews are “verified customers.”

Now ask yourself, how many of the glowing 5-star reviews show “verified customer”?

It Could well be a case of fake 5-star reviews being uploaded. Trustpilot, you should require ALL REVIEWERS to be verified.

And finally this: when issues arise, and they do, frequently, the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email, let alone getting your issue resolved. They are VERY QUICK to ask you for a review and “tell us how we’re doing”

Well I am telling you how you’re doing. DISGRACEFUL.

That said, I hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using Shipbob.

The software is poorly designed, the customer support is worthless, and we were billed thousands more than we expected. Shipbob shouldn’t be trusted with your mission-critical fulfillment. The ""support"" team is pathetically incompetent and clueless.

I'll share just TWO of many horrible experiences. 1) We wanted a quote to move some inventory from Shipbob last year before the holidays. Their process for getting a quote is to create a shipping order and write ""DO NOT SHIP"" for each line in the address. We did that, but somehow they managed to ship our order instead of just giving us a quote. I don't know how, but they literally sent the order to the address ""DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP DO NOT SHIP"". I don't know where the large shipment of boxes went, but it took about two months before Shitbob returned our inventory. Shipbob's mistake caused us to miss out on busiest shopping season of the year—the entire holiday season from Black Friday to Christmas! We lost a huge amount of revenue because Shipbob essentially disappear our inventory for nearly two months. Yet, Shipbob provided zero compensation to us for their mistake.

2) Recently I noticed charges on my credit card statement from Shipbob for $75 day-after-day, going back for months. I asked them what's going on, and they said they received a box with three books back on August 9th, and so they were billing us $25-per-book-per-day ($75 per day!) for storage on their dock because I didn't create a Warehouse Receiving Order for the items. We didn't ship this package to them. Apparently some third-party sent it. They send us one email about it, and then, without ever reaching out to us again or highlighting the issue on the web portal, they just billed us over $5,000 ($75 per day for more than two months)! Insane! This in akin to the worst kinds of predatory financial scams.

Shipbob: your customers need a fulfillment service we can depend on, but your service is extremely unreliable. I've been grossly overbilled, but you wouldn't acknowledge mistakes. And I have to write over-and-over-and-over again requesting help for the same issues because no one takes any real ownership or responsibility for seeing customer problems are resolved. Your reps only fire off a quick and useless reply leaving us frustrated and further damaging our business with fulfillment delays and canceled orders. Day-after-day-after-day, I'm spending way too many hours trying to make this work, and our business and customer are suffering from it. I'd rather spend my time growing my own business than wasting countless hours with your useless support team. These ongoing problems have delayed shipments by days and weeks cost us lost orders, creating irate customers, and damaging our relationships with partners like Amazon Advantage. It's so utterly frustrating sometimes I feel as if I'm going to have a heart attack.

I hate to disparage anyone's business, but you doing us a great disservice. Shipbob is ruining a small business we've been working on for 13 years. If you can't fix these problems for us ASAP, you should compensate us fully for the cost of moving our inventory elsewhere. We thought moving to Shipbob from Rakutensl (formerly Webgistix) was going to save us some money. We deeply regret our decision to use your service.

I've talked to the Shipbob leadership a few times about my issues, but there was no improvement. Clearly, they doesn't know how to create a great company. 1 in 5 Trustpilot reviewers give Shipbob the lowest possible score. Save yourself the trouble, and avoid these amateurs.

We have had a terrible experience working with ShipBob and would encourage other companies to avoid using them at all costs even if it means paying more for storage/fulfillment.

We have had errors/issues with ~20%+ of our shipments they have fulfilled. For context, we have a pretty straightforward fulfillment needs as we sell wholesale and so only need case picks. Despite this, the list of problems is never-ending, and includes but is not limited to, sending a single unit instead of a case, sending another company's inventory to our customers, not sending shipments out on time, sending shipments under the wrong shipping option (ex. Ground instead of expedited), overbilling for storage, unnecessarily repackaging or case-packed product, poor communication between customer service reps, and so on.

It is clear that there huge holes in their operations and procedures, and that despite months of problems, issues continue to occur. We have had to spend hours on the phone to get issues corrected and have almost lost customers due to the neverending shipping issues they have caused.

I found that ShipBob has one of the most robust, flawless and completely seamless integration with Shopify's order fulfillment system. This has saved me lot of time in trying to manually send the shipping information file to the fulfillment provider.

Shipbob has introduced a new analytics tool that allows you to get proactive and manage your customer's expectations. I can also plan my inventory better using this tool. Here is the cool feature that I liked the most: As the orders increase and more data comes through, I can play around, switch on and off different warehouses and see the projected shipping rates and average shipping times. So why is this important? Because now I can figure out what warehouses should I send my product to in order to get the best saving in terms of shipping rates and the best customer experience in terms of average shipping time.

Shipbob's founder Dhruv Saxena is pretty engaged and reached out to me when I was having trouble. He helped me sort out my issues successfully.

5d6ccefbf0186907108a9a4d,Nothing Compares! You Should Read This!,US,"This review is been long overdue, and you should probably read this review to the end, if you're considering doing business with ShipBob!

We partnered up with ShipBob early of 2018, to handle all of our ecommerce inventory management and fulfillment. we were mainly intrigued by their simple pricing structure and same day shipping option.

The decision to switch to ShipBob from a previous fulfillment provider was executed after extensive research at the time, as we've tried a couple different 3PL partners in the past that only led to issues.

From week 1 of working with ShipBob, we started noticing that orders were being shipped as promised, their basic 3-7 day shipping option didn't disappoint as it was quick enough for our intended purpose and shipping rate structures, I would say in 8 out of 10 times, orders were and are still being delivered in under or around 4 days on average from ordering to delivery.

Their web interface is super friendly and easy to use, and their API integrates flawlessly with our shopify store.

Their email support is super prompt and thoroughly professional

All was going great up until we started seeing in their email newsletter early this year (2019) that they're expanding their operation, and this is when things got a bit rocky. all of the sudden the cost per shipment skyrocketed and it was very inconsistent and totally unpredictable.

After numerous attempts to understand what was happening and trying to find a fast resolution, it took some time to get clarity on the situation as we finally learned that they invested in newer tools and introduced state of the art scanning and weighing technology (similar to amazon robots) which should've been a ""Pro"" but it wasn't in beginning as there was apparently a learning curve to this new technology!

So let me give you a bit more context on what exactly was happening and what that scanning technology was supposed to do. I believe it's called ""Cubiscan"", which is a 3D robotic system that is intended to streamline the fulfillment operation by accurately scanning and weighting any given SKU within the system to be able to give the human picker/packer efficient and accurate data on what is the best and most cost effective shipping label and box size to use when shipping a given order based on its quantity, dimensions and shipping destination! This was obviously designed to make the shipping process faster, cheaper and more accurate.

Sounds good, right? we thought so too! but the issue that when they implemented this system, it required all the vendors (people like you and me) to update the nature of their products within the system, to basically tell this robot if the product being shipped was fragile, stackable, foldable or if it required a custom / special box, etc..

This was obviously in place to save on ""Dimensional Weight"" in our favor, which is the key metric that determines the cost per shipment with any shipping carrier.

And while this should've been a simple and easy task, it led to lots of inconsistency and higher shipping charges in the beginning, simply due to the fact that we didn't really know or understood what it all meant and how it would affect the shipping rate!

And so of-course as any wise brand would do, we marked every possible secure/fancy option (none stackable, fragile, custom box) not knowing that this would translate into empty space within any given shipping box, which means, that if we were shipping a product that is 12x12x12 for example, that it would require a much larger shipping box to accommodate the preferences we selected and allow room for lots of packing / padding material! But bigger box simply means higher cost in the shipping label! So you can only imagine what it would be like if were shipping 2, 3 or more items at once, which is typically how we market our products and incentivize the shopper to buy more for the sake of AOV!

This understanding of the issue, came a bit late aftersome frustration and almost having to walk away from ShipBob altogether (Im So Glad We Did Not) as Dhruv ""Co-Founders of ShipBob"" reached out to us personally in his attempt to help us understand the situation and change our recent experience, and I must admit that I was blown away by his level of dedication, courtesy and professionalism along with his team to get us back on track and rebuild our trust and confidence level once again.

Dhruv worked tirelessly and seemed to have our best interest at heart (which is extremely rare to find these days), not once has he denied the issue or tried to sugarcoat it, he knew what was wrong, took the time to explain it to us and quickly executed a recovery plan to get back on track.

He attended to every scheduled call with positive “can do” attitude, gave us his undivided attention throughout the process and kept us updated along the way. He also took ownership of the overcharges that were a consequence of the above mentioned issues, which some may argue that was the right thing to do, but honestly this was an error on both parties ""us and them"" being that we went overboard with our box and packing preferences not knowing what it would do! An honorable and a big move on his end in my opinion that many choose to look the other way and neglect!

In my 18+ years of entrepreneurship and the number of entities I was a part of building, establishing and operating, I haven't seen many like him, which not only resulted in fixing our problems, it also gave us the confidence that we were in good hands moving forward! Because by the end of the day, nothing and no one is perfect and issues as well as mishaps do rise and come up in every business model, it's part of growing, and as a private brand, we ourselves had our own fair share of trials and errors and that's how we all learn and evolve! The most important part is learning from the mistakes and working hard on recovering from them, and Dhruv as a the face of the company, truly demonstrated his abilities of caring and recovering from any issue no matter how messy it can be.

He also put his team on our account ""Voluntarily"" to perform a full audit and was happy to compensate us for any overcharges that occured during that period

Its now been over 3 months since this issue was resolved, and everything seems to be moving like clockwork. Orders are shipped promptly and being delivered in a timely manner as promised.

Overall, I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend ShipBob to anyone looking for a reliable fulfillment PARTNER and ready to scale their ecommerce business. as they're now stronger than ever and will most definitely benefit your business now that they have every smart tool in the shed sharpened and ready to go in your favor while saving you time and money.

I contacted support through live chat. I had to ask them FOUR TIMES to delete my account. They said I wouldn't be contacted again. I was sent four emails asking for ""feedback.""

I was then contacted a day later by their business development manager wanting to know if Shipbob was the right company for my business. I asked him why I was being contacted, why he is still using my information after my account had been deleted, and asked for a link to their privacy policy and GDPR compliance. I haven't received a response.

This company is a joke. Do not deal with them.

UPDATE: July 6th Shipbob contacted me on Trustpilot, with the excuse that they ""just got access to this account, hence the delay"". They asked me to provide my ""real name and email address"" so they could look into this. This is outrageous, considering my original complaint was that they abused the data I provided when I signed up. These people continue to be a joke. DO NOT GIVE THEM ANY BUSINESS.

ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob reported my review for being false, as they have done with several other one-star reviews. Trustpilot contacted me for proof of my interactions and I sent every shred of evidence I have including the chat logs I saved and their continuous spamming of my email address. These people will do whatever it takes to get bad reviews off this site. Most businesses concentrate on delivering excellent customer service, but these people just try to scrub the evidence from the internet.

PROSPECTIVE BUYERS, TAKE NOTE: Shipbob's recent 5-star reviews, which suddenly took them from a one-star to four-star company, are suspect: They are vague, unverified, and lack detail - classic hallmarks of fakery. They're also posted at regular intervals. Trustpilot should be monitoring this.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE: Shipbob, despite my review being verified by Trustpilot as true, reported my review. They also posted a taunting reply to my review, saying that they can't remove my data if I won't give them my email address (despite, as verified in the initial review, they abused my data when they should have removed it). Take that as all the proof you need of their professionalism and honesty.

Shipbob has a great fulfillment center and dashboard, but they have two cons (which are important to me and might not be to you). #1 They lack the ability to push/sync Inventory Live with Shopify. Other Fulfillment centers offer this product. #2 They won't push live courier rates... you need to manually map your rates to Shopify's Shipping Rates.

Their on-time shipping rate is close to zero. Don't expect them to ship anything in a day as they claim. Takes anywhere 2-3 days. Even when they mark it as ship, it usually won't leave their warehouse until next day.

2. They refuse to admit fault and compensate for any errors they make. We had it all, they double to triple overcharged us for postage, sent our customers wrong items, refused to cover for return shipping for incorrect item, chose the cheapest shipping method when we paid for expedited, take 3-4 weeks to register a return parcel, charged us for receiving a returned parcel AFTER charging us for a return label, and the list goes on.

60a9c968f9f4870b700bb705,Immoral and unethical... STAY AWAY!!,US,"This company is terrible. I was a client with Shipmonk for 2 years and here are just a FEW of the mishaps I had to deal with.

1. Support tickets go answered for days, weeks, MONTHS then mysteriously get marked as Resolved. I have to open another ticket to get my issue addressed, most of the time it’s multiple tickets because they never answer them.

2. Special Projects go ignored. I submitted a request to label, repack and ship to Amazon FBA. It went untouched for 2 MONTHS. When I asked about the status they ignored me and marked it as Resolved.

3. I requested a wholesale order be palletized and shipped. Their website clearly states wholesale orders will be ready to ship within 2 DAYS. It went untouched for 10 DAYS until I followed up with them. Their LTL freight quotes were ridiculous. $492 for 3 pallets to travel 60 miles. I used my own freight forwarder and only paid $350. Do not use their freight forwarder, use your own. Then they charged me $192 to palletize 3 pallets of product! My second wholesale order they charged me $385 to palletize 6 pallets! (Most 3PLs charge $10/pallet.)

4. I created 4 wholesale orders and provided them prepaid UPS labels. They disregarded my instructions and billed me for shipping! I asked to be reimbursed because I provided them with PREPAID LABELS but they flat out said NO. I filed a dispute with my credit card company to get my money back. For unknown reasons my bank sided with Shipmonk and reimbursed them the funds. Then Shipmonk RE-BILLED ME for the exact same amount! Now they have DOUBLE the money they were never supposed to bill me for in the first place. I asked for a refund of the second charges but they refused. I even showed them the letter from my bank saying they sided with Shipmonk but they claimed they never received the reimbursed funds.

They also charged me $13.50 per carton to slap a label on it and put it out for UPS to pick up. (Most 3PLs charge $5 a carton.)

5. Three times they asked what I would like done with customer returns that were returned to their warehouse. I said ship them back to me but I never received any product.

6. They do not provide photos of customer returns so you cannot verify the customer actually returned the correct product. All you get is an email notification and you are at liberty to refund the customer. They could have returned a counterfeit item or a pile of rocks but you would never know.

7. Don't bother submitting a ticket when a customer package gets lost in transit. They do not respond. You can't even file the claim yourself with the shipper because Shipmonk has all of the shipping information and they will not give it to you.

8. They ""lost"" 20 cartons of my product and refused to reimburse me for the product cost or the supposed storage fees I was paying on it.

9. Closing my account was a headache and the process took over 5 weeks. TWICE they said they would credit my account if I signed their Closing Agreement which had a very detailed non-disparagement clause, meaning I could not say or post anything negative about them. Obviously they were aware I was upset with their services and were trying to shut me up. Sounds like a bribe! I flat out said NO I am not signing this. I thought my account was closed and then I got hit with their $250 monthly minimum fee on my account! AGAIN they said they would credit me the $250 if I sign their non-disparagement agreement. I said NO again and threatened to hire an attorney and pursue legal action if they didn't close my account immediately. That seemed to do the trick and I am finally done with these clowns.

Working with Shipmonk has been the worst decision I ever made for my business. They will fight you tooth and nail for every single red cent they can get out of you. They NEVER take responsibility for mistakes, it’s always YOUR FAULT. If you are doing wholesale orders, LTL shipping or Amazon FBA then this place is a nightmare to deal with.

60527c06f85d7503942d998f,DO NOT USE SHIPMONK - RUN AWAY NOW,US,"if you are looking for a new 3PL, let me just start by saying.... DO NOT USE SHIPMONK. There are so many better options out there and the biggest regret ever is that I used ShipMonk for the past 18 months.

This is my break up letter with ShipMonk and I couldn't be more excited to leave them.

Not only is the customer service TERRIBLE, but so was my fulfillment experience. They offer a nice online system to check on orders, but lets talk about the important stuff.

SHIPPING PRICES: One of the main reasons you use a good 3PL is to have the ability to take advantage of their cheaper / negotiated rates. Not the case here... rather than get cheaper rates, they are charging you more for every single carrier. I was getting cheaper rates using ShipStation back when I shipped myself. They are charging you as much as possible to just provide more profits for them, truly not caring for these small businesses they are providing services for.

2 DAY SHIPPING? RUN AS FAR AS YOU CAN FROM SHIPMONK!!!! In todays world, expedited shipping is becoming the new standard, and if you are looking to offer that to your -customers, MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COMPANY FAST. ShipMonk's 2-Day shipping cost was so incredibly high.. there were MANY cases where I would pay for their ""custom label fee"" which is $5, provide my own label via ShipStation, and it would STILL be cheaper than the cost they were giving me. How does that even happen? They offer 'DHL EXPEDITED MAX (2-3 BUSINESS DAY) and I did a report on all shipments that used this service and almost NONE made it there within 5 business days, causing me to refund SO many customers that paid extra for expedited shipping. I prefer USPS priority as I think the prices are fair, but they don't offer this for the 48 domestic states, only for Hawaii and Alaska which is the biggest joke EVER.

LOST SHIPMENTS: This past year I've lost over 100 shipments with DHL and other random carriers they brought on and they didn't care about replacing these orders or reimbursing those costs.

INVENTORY: I have hundreds of products so this was difficult, but I caught many mistakes on our weights and dimensions of products that were WAY WAY WAY OFF, which means you get charged more for shipping when you shouldn't be. You literally have to baby sit and monitor there every move to make sure things are done correctly, but no small business has the time for this.

STORAGE COSTS: There storage costs are pretty standard.. but want to know the worst part? They won't tell you what they are charging for each specific product. I wanted a way to see which product was being charged what, especially after selling through 90% of the inventory where maybe the product was in a bigger bin previously, and now I know it should have been moved to something smaller. I asked if I could get a report of all my storage costs, but they were unable to do so. Just said 'we don't offer that'. How are you generating these costs if you can't tell me what the cost is for each product?

PICK FEES: Pick fees are MUCH higher than the competition. You will find cheaper with any other 3pl, trust me.

When it came to closing my account, I was prepared to file a lawsuit it got so bad and I honestly wish I did. To 'close out my account and move my inventory' it took a whopping 35 days. You read that right.. 35 DAYS! That's 35 days of not being able to take sales. Thankfully - I had our best sellers already on Amazon so I could manually fulfil orders, but this is just a joke. Not only did it take this long to get my inventory picked up, they messed up NUMEROUS cartons mislabeling the contents and didn't label my pallets correctly.

I ended up leaving them to go with Shopify Fulfillment Network, but if you don't qualify for them, I highly recommend ShipBob. I received quotes from over 5 3PL's and if I wasn't going with Shopify, ShipBob was my next choice.

Now that you've read this long review, stop any communication with them as soon as you can! :)

When looking for a 3PL, I evaluated probably close to 10 options. Shipmonk seemed like the best one and after working with them for close to a year, I'm confident that I've made the right decision.

603ed1bff85d750648fe5549,Overall a good company,BR,"Overall a good company. I've used other 3PL solutions in the past, and so far, ShiMonk has been the best. They are not perfect in my opinion, they have strengths and weaknesses. To me, their strengths are in the efficiency/speed to ship the orders, in the Customer service and software side of things. You always receive a reply from a happiness engineer really fast, and they are very polite and kind people, which makes the experience great. I also had to talk with my account manager to negotiate some prices, and he was super kind and open to discuss the prices, to keep us as a customer. The software/dashboard is good, with a lot of insights, nice UX, and it's easy to use and understand what's happening, even if you have lots of orders and SKUs.
Now, to the weak points. Fulfillment errors are not so uncommon as you'd like, at least in my experience. I thought they were happening because it was Q4, near the Holidays, but they kept happening when entering January and also February. The good part is that they refund you for those mistakes after you fill a claim, but this could happen much less in my opinion, because it definitely hurts your brand image if it happens too much (nobody likes receiving wrong orders). Another thing I don't like is the way they charge you for some things like Storage. It's confusing, and not transparent in my opinion. For example, my product is small, and is stocked in few units (most of the times less than 1000 units). It could theoretically fit their smallest bin for each SKU, however, I also pay for storage space for other bigger storage places. I remember asking about this some time ago, but I did not get a satisfactory explanation and I still don't understand why I have to pay for the bigger storage spaces if my product could easily fit in their smaller/cheapest storage unit. Other than that, everything is good. I would love it if they could solve those points, would easily earn a 5 star instead of 4. If you are on the fence, I think you should at least give them a try, overall it has been a good service to us.",2021-03-03T00:01:03.000Z,2,0,Raphael,4.0,2021-05-28 13:25:35.768415,2021-05-28 13:25:37.491458

Their closing agreement that they force customers to sign goes against the constitution and against the 1st amendment right. The closing agreement is a modification of the original service agreement. They know that nobody would sign when acquiring customers so they do a sneaky thing and force you to sign it at the very end when they hold your products a hostage. This is fully illegal and don’t let them get away with this. If you are a company that has experienced the same mistreatment by ShipMonk, make sure to reach out to an attorney regard this and make sure to sue ShipMonk. We canceled our account almost 6 months ago and we signed our “closing agreement” back in November. We missed two of our largest sales (Black Friday and Christmas sale) due to their refusal to closeout out account. We still haven’t received our products and we will most likely have to write them off as stolen. They also still charge us for storage. Whatever you do, make sure to avoid this company, do not remove your reviews and make sure to hire legal help. As an entrepreneur of 15 years I have never worked with such an immoral company.

This company almost ruined our ecommerce business. We are still trying to get our products from their warehouse and they are not releasing them.

The customer service was woeful when dealing with Ship Monk and they charged me thousands throughout 2020 when I only had 49 units of stock. So you have an understanding, the stock could have fit in 8 shoe boxes and when i asked their team for a stock count they just didn't get back to me.

Seems pretty unreasonable to charge someone $2,000 + storage fees in a few short months to have a few units in their warehouse when they didn't give me a stock count.

I would not use Ship Monk if i were you, look into their hidden fees and if they say they don't have any hidden fees they are not telling the truth.

5ff75232755dc1032c0f06bd,Absolutely the worst!,US,"Absolutely the worst!

The experience with Shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars. The bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake. When you file a claim, there is no claim# or confirmation they rcvd your claim. It just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again. It's very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake. Here are just a few examples of problems that we've had where they refuse to take responsibility

1) shipping product that isn't our. we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies. Shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product.
2) shipping in the wrong packaging: We set-up customer packaging so some of our products would ship in poly-mailers. They told us this was set up and for a while it was working. For for the past month, instead of shipping in the correct package, they decided to ship in massive 20X20X12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times! Now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $7.00. We even worked with one of their VP's to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok.
3)taking months to fulfill wholesale orders. If you need to send items to Amazon in a timely matter, you can forget about it. It takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4) Not able to fulfill Amazon FBM. They repeatedly missed the deadline causing our Amazon account to go into ""high-risk"" and nearly being shut down.
5) Took 2 months to fulfill e-commerce orders. We all knew there would be delays during the holiday, but as of January 10, we still have orders from Black Friday that have not been fulfilled. To make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on Thanksgiving that just arrived this week and Shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order.

I highly recommend using any other 3PL. While it's true that all 3PL's will make many mistakes, most 3PL's will do the right thing. Shipmonk clearly has created a business culture where they will do anything to try and avoid taking responsibility for mistakes they made. It's a very shady way of doing business and I don't expect they will be around for long unless they drastically change how they handle claims and customer complaints.",2021-01-07T18:25:54.000Z,1,2,Andy,1.0,2021-05-28 13:26:03.188129,2021-05-28 13:26:06.349655

The only good things about this business is their flashy website.

Read the contract! After their employees are done stealing your items, overcharging storage.shipping Bill's 2x what they should be you will want/need to leave. At which point they will charge you $2 or $3 for every product left in inventory (that they didn't steal yet) that you want to pick.

20,000 products? Pay $34,000 to pick up (20,000- 3,000 stolen x $2)

You think thats bad?

How much does it cost you to re-acquire customers after they mess up the shipping?

How much is your time worth on the phone dealing with ""happiness engineers"" with no authority to do/fix anything.

5e3f51423c93ae0b24a0ec3e,Heed these warnings...,US,"... if you like to stay in business.

We have been using Shipmonk for over 2 years. Their customer service is ok and so is their application but they will kill your startup with their ridiculous minimums and storage fees. To make it worse they you cannot trust what shipping they quote you, they will come back and charge 2 to 3X the original price quoted on the order. The latest example being charging $55 when the quote was $26. If I re-do the same order I am still shown $26. Its essentially fraud.

Also their minimum fees is a ridiculous concept. This is what I got from their support ""when storage exceeds $250.00 your minimum increases to the storage cost"". They already charge a premium on storage and they you end up paying 2X that because invariably your storage fees will cross usd 250 (unless you are shipping really small items with limited number of SKUs) and then that would become your new minimum, essentially doubling your storage fees. While they claim this crucial clause was always there on their website (we don't remember reading it) their sales agent never bothered to mention it during the initial meeting we had and it is not in our contract.

Also it is nearly impossible to know what you are paying for when it comes to storage ""their system"" essentially decides and there is very little visibility as to why you are paying of X number of pallets or Y number of bins. Also you would be paying for a whole pallet (X2 because of the minimums) even if you have 1 unit left on it and to make it worse you don't know so you can't do anything about it.

It is very hard to change a warehouse once you are stuck with one so do your research before you make the mistake we did.

Find someone else unless you love throwing away money. Companies like Shipmonk should go out of business so companies that do care about their customers can do well.

Echo in the line from a review below because we had to deal with the exact issue, thousands of dollars worth of lost inventory after they signed for it:
""Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving, because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs. what they actually receive and enter into the system. So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse, their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received. They have literally, on multiple occasions, lost thousands of dollars of inventory, and even when escalated to the CEO, refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it. And because they signed the delivery slip, you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper.""

5dde1495c84545093cfa4f17,Shipmonk is THE WORST part of running a business,US,"We've been using Shipmonk for a year and half now and it has honestly been the most painful part of running a business. We thought that outsourcing fulfillment to them would make our e-commerce & wholesale business easier to run, but it has been nothing short of a nightmare at every turn. Shipmonk has good software systems, but really really bad processes, and the worst customer service (worse than calling your cable or phone company).

Some examples: They lose inventory upon receiving, because they don't check what they sign for when product is delivered to them vs. what they actually receive and enter into the system. So when shipments show as delivered but the inventory is missing from the warehouse, their excuse is that they receive too many shipments to possibly try to check what was actually received. They have literally, on multiple occasions, lost thousands of dollars of inventory, and even when escalated to the CEO, refuse to accept ownership of this or do anything about it. And because they signed the delivery slip, you can no longer claim for a lost package from the shipper.

They have extremely poor customer service - they literally do not care or do anything to fix it when they make mistakes, they make the same mistakes again and again, and have no escalation path. There is literally no one even at the highest levels that will address their process issues or the huge costly mistakes they constantly make. You can email the CEO and he couldn't care less.

They are ok with direct to consumer but absolutely horrible with wholesale. It takes 1 week+ to provide shipping quotes for wholesale orders, and you have to check on them constantly to make sure wholesale orders actually go out. They will change the order status to ""shipped"", and then never provide a tracking number, so you have to remember to go back and review all of your orders to ensure they actually went out. They send international orders using shipping methods that get sent back by customs, they package products in a way where they get damaged easily, and are bad with any kind of non-standard ask.

While some businesses are very customer service oriented, Shipmonk is at the opposite spectrum. Calling their agents ""happiness engineers"" is a literal farce.

If you think running a business is hard, try running one using Shipmonk. If I can give advice to anyone looking for a fulfillment center, it would be to avoid Shipmonk, and ask other services really detailed questions about how they handle issues.

I would give Shipmonk negative stars if I could, and ask for the weeks of my life back, that were spent agonizing over all the problems they've caused that have been ludicrous or impossible to fix.

In the end you just throw your hands up and say, well I guess they've lost a few thousand dollars of inventory again and won't do anything about it, and just move on for the sake of your own sanity, rather than engaging in another pointless conversation with an enragingly unhelpful agent or executive at Shipmonk.",2019-11-27T07:40:41.000Z,1,0,Jen,1.0,2021-05-28 13:27:36.699185,2021-05-28 13:27:37.867194

We soldiered on but eventually grew tired of all the nickel and diming with 4% surcharges on all account payment methods except ACH payments, ridiculous ""packaging material"" charges (for standard size cartons and void fill) which should be part of the Pick n Pack fee and high storage fees due to the way they spread your stock out.

They also lost half a pallet of stock for a week or so (had to close Amazon listing and ShipMonk blamed their warehouse workers for it - great training there guys!) and we've had a number of damaged or lost shipments were the verdict was ""the carrier won't pay for that so don't bother claiming"".

5c3f75d59d378009a45d9126,Affordable but high-quality fulfillment service.,ES,"We've been using Shipmonk (and their associated Shopify app) for more than a year now.

The onboarding process is fairly easy and they help you connect your store to their fulfillment center, and map the SKUs to their internal inventory codes. You can also do it yourself manually if you create product bundles, for instance, or they will do it for you if you have a lot of them, just by sending them a CSV.

From that moment on, Shipmonk automatically captures the orders from Shopify, processes them, and then inserts the tracking number once the order has been fulfilled.

So all in all, it is a very straightforward process and the only work you need to do is check their interface daily to verify no orders are ""stuck"" because the buyer entered an incorret address, or you have run out of stock of any item (which you shouldn't, as they provide a forecast on how many days of inventory you have left at the current sales rate.

Here I am a full week after the shop update and not a single f-@%%@ order has ACTUALLY shipped! All orders are simply marked as pre transit.

Even worse the tracking #s being kicked back into the etsy system are registering as invalid if customers try to track orders externally.

But on top of all of this they have not PICKED OR PACKED a single order in almost THREE BUSINESS DAYS and now I have about 100 orders that are marked late by DAYS to ship or are about to be!

Also I am having to refund people right & left as they say I am backordered on items even though we meticulously counted our stock with a clicker. Even on items we only sent 16 of they say we miscounted and only had 13... I'm pretty sure I know the difference between 13 and 16.

The first batch of inventory they right off the bat lost an entire bag saying we had miscounted and only sent 1 bag of a SKU that I had TAPED together.

So here I am with hundreds and hundreds of loyal customers who are pretty upset especially because I had to raise my shipping rates to use this service.

Then to add insult to injury they aren't even shipping chronologically! So add this to the backorder issue and we are having to refund people who bought things in the very first moments of the sale while folks who placed orders days later get the item!

By now be and my husband would have had at least 1000 orders fully shipped out, sure we'd be exhausted physically and emotionally from it but at this point it may have been less stressful than not being able to do anything to help our customers.

Also this was our holiday sale so we now have to shut down our shop early as we are worried any further orders will simply not be processed or shipped in time to arrive. So I will also be loosing potential sales.

602fe6a0f85d750b989a9039,Can't Ship on Time,HK,"Avoid using Deliverr, they were about 84% on-time ship rate for us before we had to ship from our 3PL for the delayed orders to meet platform KPI. Not only is this added manual work for us, but sometimes the Deliverr platform doesn't let you cancel orders that are ""packed and ready to ship"" even though they are 3 business days delayed already. Now we're forced to decide whether to risk double shipping an order or get dinged for a late ship. This means those customers will get two shipments and have the option to return one of the shipments for a refund.

Unfortunately, there is a high cost of removal from Deliverr, so we're held as a hostage until we sell out what we have of our inventory there. I (my pocketbook too!) regret trying Deliverr. We're switching back fulfillment to our third-party warehouse instead. Link it with EDI SaaS like shipstation, find an account with discounted ship rates, and you'll end up having more reliability and about the same cost even without the economy of scale.

Integration with any new service or partner usually has its own set of unique obstacles, but Deliverr's support has been there for us and helps us work through the issues. Support has always been available, transparent, and quick to resolve issues.

Not only are they proving to be a stable fulfillment partner which allows us to support higher sales volume, but the many integration features are helping us on the marketing side as well.

5ff8b154755dc1032c102e5a,Review from a REAL Deliverr client - service has gone seriously downhill.,US,"Don't do it! I have been a Deliverr client for 16 months. Their service is a great concept and prices are great, and it started out OK, but they are growing way too fast or something. The service has seriously gone downhill in the last few months. For example:
- Orders over Cyber Monday took 2 weeks to ship out and almost got canceled by Walmart. Despite what Deliverr claims, this still hurts your Walmart delivery metrics.
- They are CONSTANTLY losing inventory now - both inbound and inventory in their warehouse. They sit on orders for a few days and then email you saying you should manually fulfill it, because they lost the inventory, leaving you to scramble to ship it out yourself. This is happening for 30-50% of orders lately.
- Their support is helpful but EXTREMELY slow. It takes WEEKS and multiple messages to hear back from them. Several times, I had to email their executive team directly to get any kind of response.
- They don't add any bubble wrap or protective packing to boxes. They literally stick your product inside a big cardboard box and seal it up. Absolutely indefensible for a reputable fulfillment company like them. I emailed about this multiple times, but they didn't seem at all concerned about it and didn't promise they would change anything.

5fdf9c0f755dc107e0c998bc,A joke of a company.,US,"Site looks easy to use, but that's where the positives end. Outbound SLAs are frequently missed with no penalty. New warehouses are frequently onboarded and offboarded, causing inventory to be unavailable for weeks while moved from warehouse to warehouse. Inbounds take almost a month to check in. Shipments are frequently lost or tracking information is simply incorrect and the claims policy is inconsistent. I do not trust inventory levels, and canceled orders for stockouts frequently occur without fast alert (email takes 2+ days to let me know an order has been canceled) or visibility into why an order was canceled. These issues are frequently blamed on listing tools, while I experience the same issues creating orders manually. I have had customers contact me to let me know they have received 10s of extra units they did not order (and I can only imaging how many hundreds of units are out in the world that customers have not let me know they have). Support team is not well trained and obviously understaffed as tickets take days and sometimes weeks to receive a response. Measuring process is inconsistent and warehouses frequently make mistakes; I have had to manually audit all my dimensions and request reimbursement for overcharged fees. Tickets frequently need to be escalated as support staff cannot keep up with frequently changing policies.

Inbounds are rarely received within the said time frame. Talking about 3weeks plus delays and all they will tell you is 'they are investigating'

My goods were to be shipped in boxes as per agreement but they kept shipping in polybags causing damage. All they will do is reimburse you (for the customers who cared to complain. The others will simply never come back. ( got less returning customers from their side). They will promise it won't happen again, then it does the very next few days.

Pretty common for orders to remain hanging after they have been marked as fulfilled. I'd only realise after some chargebacks hit me or refund request emails from customers.

There are some aspects that can be improved, but Deliverr is doing its' best during this pandemic with the resources available.

There are two aspects of Deliverr that I find unique and advantageous. First, we are able to receive support from an actual person. Our growth manager has been consistent about checking in with us and helping our company thrive with Deliverr (Thanks, Tyler!) With the other third-party fulfillment service, we are constantly being passed around to different people and has been difficult to get issues resolved timely.

Their 2-day and next day badges helped our website grow from $10,000 a month last year to $150,000 a month this year.

The only cons are that some of the carriers partnered with Deliverr have a tendency to lose shipments. But this could also be attributed to the increase shipment numbers of 2020 across the board. The other problem is that having a third party fulfill our orders increases a harder to resolve customer service questions as most customer service questions revolve around fulfillment.

Tyler,

Our account has been inaccesible for 3 days now without resolution--the system stopped recognizing it. We will be moving both of our accounts to another service as soon as possible:
• Tech support is incompetent, often referring problems to “other team members” who then fail to respond in a timely manner, if at all.
• Tech support response time is never prompt, sometimes taking 48 hours+ to respond that a response is coming.
• Deliverr has no method for personal contact, email only. This isn’t enough in case of an emergency, and there does not appear to be any prioritization of support requests.
• Apparently customer support closes on the weekends.
• All businesses must deal with the problems of the Corona Virus, but Deliverr has demonstrated no ability to adapt or improve its support.

We request you forward this information as far up the company ladder as possible. Deliverr is a company that is “in over its head.”

We sell supplements and were looking for a new pick, pack, ship partner around 2 months ago. We chose Deliverr over ShipBob and so far are very happy with our choice.

- To date we have sent in 2 inbound shipments, each to 4 different fulfillment centers. The receiving has been relatively slow (1 to 2 weeks) but all items have been eventually received with no errors or missing inventory.
- Deliverr has shipped out to numerous customers using ground, expedited and Walmart 2-day delivery. These shipments have all gone out either same day or next business day. We also sent some test shipments and the packages all arrived in good condition. A small issue is that the packaging used varies from warehouse to warehouse and there is no packing slip or invoice included.
- Our account executive, Shawn Sprauer, did a great job both during the sales process and while we were onboarding with Deliverr. He also helped us get approved to sell on Walmart and really made a difference during the Walmart onboarding process. We are now selling on Walmart with free 2-day delivery.

MAIN ISSUES

1. Deliverr is a B2B software + service. But they do not allow user permissions. Organizations cannot create sub-accounts for employees to use. Everyone is forced to use the main master account which include sensitive billing info and other user functions that the shipping manager does not need access too.

2. Initial registered email on Deliverr account cannot be changed. The first and only email you can ever sign up with Deliverr is set in stone and unable to be changed at all in the future. YESSS, its 2020 and this is still happening!!

3. Deliverr's software does not allow you to untie a sales channel integration. So if you integrated a sales channel with a Deliverr account. Be prepared for that sales channel to lock into your Deliverr account FOREVER.

This was my experience. I signed up with Deliverr and with my google account, thinking I can just create a sub-account for my staff...

WRONG - no user permission function available. Our whole organization need to use the registered email to log in. and I had already integrated my sales channel to the account.

BUT NOOOO. new email would not allow us to integrate our sales channel. Stating it is still tied to the old account.

Reached out to customer service, it took them 8 days to come to the conclusion that they are unable to untie it, and said they can change over the registered google account to another email.

BUT you are screwed the second you have any sort of issue. This is for the simple reason that there is no one to speak to. You have to create tickets that take 24 to 48 hours to get a response. Usually the response you just waited 2 days for is them asking for more information, then prepare to wait another 2 days to hear back. I have to escalate almost every issue with my account manager otherwise the average resolution time is about 2 weeks. Deliverr, if you are reading this, your company has so much potential!

5e9a1722086b6409bc8724c2,Deliverr not honoring onboarding promotions,US,"Deliverr did indeed call us the same day I posted this review below. They were very supportive and granted us the advertised promotion.

Our company rarely writes reviews, but are having such a difficult time with Deliverr onboarding promotions, this warranted a quick 5 minutes. We are (were) a $2 million company, trying our best to manage and weather the COVID storm. With supply chain and fulfillment understandably locking up at Amazon, we were turning to new vendors to assist us for our B2C deliveries from various channels. Deliverr came highly recommended by a few business colleagues! We were told about a $500 promotion - both for the onboarding company (us) as well as the firm who referred Deliverr.

But once we signed up, our IT team spent a half business day integrating with our Walmart account, eBay account, Ecommerce site, and Amazon Prime ... that sales rep simply ""ghosted"" and refused to approve the promotion.

Really bad business and pretty harsh customer service - especially given the hurdles we small companies are all facing during the economy changes. What a lost opportunity, as we would have turned around and referred then to all of our network of company owners?

And when conversion grows, usually your ranking grows across all keywords, which brings even more sales.

I might add that the platform also have a very pleasant interface and colors.

4) It's alive! By this I mean the platform keeps improving, and fast. Just last month they added an option to inbound all shipments to one location (Before you had to send it to 4 different locations) and it's improving every week.

When the actually ship the product, the service works well. The problem is their support is just awful. I have had several delays in shipments over the last week and they won't respond for at least a day, which is a big deal when the customer is promised two-day shipping.

When they have responded to this, the answer I have received is ""we have to check with operations. It is peak season, this sometimes happens.""

I attempted to send in a critical mass of my items to get the ball rolling, but had to send in more than I wanted -- with Amazon FBA I would typically send in 2-3 units of a new item, whereas here it was a minimum of 10 per SKU (now down to 5), and then as soon as a couple of the units sell, you lose your Fast Tag shipping tag, thus defeating the purpose (the only way Deliverr can meet the 2-day shipping requirement is by having units near the customer, so if you have units in stock at Deliverr but not at enough fulfillment centers, you lose the tag).

Then I start getting invoices every two weeks for $80 here, $200 there – wild amounts of storage charges for my tiny products. I have products where I can fit 100+ in a single cubic foot. I thought my storage fees would be nominal. Little did I know!

Now I have to pay again to get all my items shipped back to me. Oh, and I also had to pay for an integration partner (Sellbrite, SellerActive, Geekseller, etc.) to integrate in the first place.

All our inventories have been moved with great care and zero damage until now. Hoping the same services for future as well. And, their charges are competitive as compared to other similar companies. Time wise, it’s as expected: A few days off estimated transit times and delays at customs, but come on people, did you not realize there’s an pandemic! This is why you plan your inventory and arrange your supplies restock schedules ahead of time with sufficient buffer. “Just in time inventory” planning is not gonna work when there’s a global disease that’s killed close to 500k people here in the US, and impacted millions. If you think your suppliers or service providers are responsible for keeping your products in stock in light of what’s happening, I’m sorry Buddy, but no - it’s your problem.

Take a look at their ""positive"" reviews and the reviewers that left them",US,"TWO extremely poor experiences with Coshipper for my shipment from China to USA. Their quotes for their transit times are as true as unicorns and fairies. They may be listed on Amazon's vendors list for shipping but trust that it won't be long - they are absolutely the worst shipping service you could pick. Do not say you weren't warned - they will give you the runaround for any status you ask for after you pay (they do not provide third party tracking, just their own manual tracking which they update with any info as they please). Plagued with dishonesty and confusion, they do not take ANY responsibility for their poor services.

Here are some excuses (I received all 4) you may hear when the goods have not been delivered. Mind you they picked up the goods in SEPTEMBER 2020 and this is in JANUARY 2021:
1. We are unable to make a delivery appointment. We have been urging every day
2. The goods have already been delivered. When asked the date, they then realize it hasn't been delivered
3. The goods need to be dismantled from the shelf
4. The goods were stuck in customs for weeks causing delay

As another reviewer said, DO NOT FALL FOR IT! We have since disputed the payment on PayPal as they have lost all credibility. They are now trying to ask me to wire them more money directly to their bank account. What a nightmare. It will be an expensive and frustrating lesson for you.

Also a tip, I've asked them to QC for any damages to my products before they ship out, and there have been no damages due to transit to the products either so far. My advise to some is to make sure you get the best packaging possible at the manufacture side, and to make sure QC is done before you ship out or else its very hard to find the ones accountable as your distributors or end customers are gonna complain to you if and when truth hits the fan.
