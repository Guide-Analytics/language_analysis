Recently I assisted my 81 year old uncle in selling his Vancouver condo. Heather Mah and her team handled the entire listing and sale remotely as my uncle had moved to Vancouver Island to live with me. Both he and I are very impressed with her! He writes ""Heather did a very thorough job for me. She is very helpful and considerate - keeping me informed and dealing with every aspect of this sale. She helped me so much with the readjustment of leaving my home and moving to my new location. I am grateful! This is the second time I have used her service, and I would definitely have her as my realtor again! I highly recommend her as a wonderful agent to handle your real estate affairs.""

Heather was always on top of everything from providing answers to all my questions to looking into permits (essential!). She got to know my personality and needs to help find the right house for me. Heather fights for the best price for her clients - it was her idea to negotiate more money off the purchase price after my home inspection as the price that I was paying 'did not sit right with her'. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a realtor.","09 October, 2019",Craig M, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah,I would recommend her to anyone looking for a realtor.,would recommend her to anyone looking for a realtor,0.8654361963272095,comm_real,realtor

It is a pleasure to know Heather Mah and to have such a knowledgeable realtor guide us through both the successful sale of our home in Vancouver and subsequent purchase of an apartment in Burnaby. Heather was with us all the way through, for example with suggestions of how important it is to have a qualified Home Inspector and to obtain detail documentation on the condition of the property. Heather also advised us on many other matters that were so helpful in leading to a final and happy conclusion.","14 August, 2019",Eric Dent," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah,It is a pleasure to know Heather Mah and to have such a knowledgeable realtor guide us through both the successful sale of our home in Vancouver and subsequent purchase of an apartment in Burnaby.,is a pleasure to know Heather Mah and to have such a knowledgeable realtor guide us through both the successful sale of our home in Vancouver and subsequent purchase of an apartment in Burnaby,0.9974045157432556,comm_real,realtor

I have been working with Heather Mah from Remax since I purchased my first home in 2005. When I was selling she was the first person whom I turned to for real estate advice. She not only advised me as a realtor but supported me as a person. From that moment on she made a life long client in me and I constantly refer to anyone who will listen! When I was ready to purchase my current condo, without hesitation I contacted Heather! Throughout the process, Heather remained strong and kept me focused on the practicality of my purchase rather than how cute or not cute I thought it was. I remember one of the selling realtors stating ""She sure has champagne taste on a beer budget!"" and Heather turned to him and said ""We will find what she wants"". Thanks to Heather and the timing of the market I was able to cash in on a great deal and bought something better than I could ever have dreamed of! Thanks Heather you are the best!","23 December, 2018",Chantel Jones," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah,She not only advised me as a realtor but supported me as a person.,not only advised me as a realtor but supported me as a person,0.9606478810310364,comm_real,realtor

Heather was our realtor for both buying and selling our home. She is honest, professional and committed to getting the best results for her clients. When we were selling, she helped us stage our place to make it as attractive as possible to prospective buyers. When we were buying, she provided us with a lot of valuable information about what type of home would best suit our current and future needs.
She was able to figure out our needs by getting to know us on a personal level. I was really impressed by her prompt response to the many questions we had throughout the buying and selling process. She is also very caring as she made sure we were happy with our decision.
We were able to sell our place at the price we wanted and buy a place of our choice with her in a very short period of time.

Heather Mah is an extraordinary realtor who carries her passion for the ""clients experience"" throughout the entire buying/selling process. An authenticate professional who treats every client like a family member, every client as if they are her one and only. It takes a seasoned professional to truly hear and understand the needs of her clients. Heather managed my last purchase and I can honestly say the journey she created was mastery in motion! She heard what I was looking for, was able to locate exactly the type of property I wanted, negotiated the right price, researched the property/determined market value and condition all within an extremely tight timeline and competitive environment. She is a master of relations and negotiations, the seller was just as pleased with the way the transaction was handled as much as I was, the buyer. Heather created a win-win as well as a client for life! I give Heather my highest recommendation and a special thanks to her for making the home buying process such a positive and memorable experience!","12 December, 2018",Corinne S.," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah,"Heather Mah is an extraordinary realtor who carries her passion for the ""clients experience"" throughout the entire buying/selling process.","is an extraordinary realtor who carries her passion for the ""clients experience"" throughout the entire buying/selling process",0.9985793828964233,comm_real,realtor

Amazing, Amazing, Amazing - Is our first thought of Heather Mah. We became friends with Heather when she moved into our neighbourhood. When the time came and we made the difficult decision to sell our family home we turned to her on a professional level. From the moment we said go, we couldn't have put our trust in a better realtor. Her caring, reassuring support made the procedure as easy as possible. The countless hours and hard work she put in went above and beyond our expectations. Every detail was meticulously carried out keeping us well informed on all aspects of the process. With her extensive knowledge and guidance we were able to complete the sale in a very short time. Now we are in the market for a new home and without any hesitation we have enlisted our little Ninja to continue the journey with us. We would be lost without her. We will ""sing her praises"" to anyone who asks. Remax is very fortunate to have such an outstanding, dedicated, personable agent on their team.","12 December, 2018",Louise Gilmore, Burnaby,5.0,2021-06-17 16:00:31.790103,2021-06-17 16:00:34.919977,HofVan Real Estate Group - Heather Mah,"From the moment we said go, we couldn't have put our trust in a better realtor.",couldn't have put our trust in a better realtor,-0.8200600743293762,comm_real,realtor

My experience in dealing with Heather has been mind changing. My past opinion of realtor's is that they are only out to get their commission. Not Heather. She treated our buying and selling if it was her own purchase. She was very detailed on her searching for the right property for us, was never pressuring us on any decisions, available to us at all times and much, much more.

Heather Mah is a fantastic agent. She is very professional in all aspects of real estate. Being new in the real estate market she guided me through everything step by step and explained it all to me. On some of the matters I was given the pros and the cons for the situation and able to make up my mind then. Heather was very flexable with her time. She accommodated us with our meeting times since we worked different work shifts. She also was keeping us informed from a trip overseas. Her lines of communication were open any where and at any time. I was given updates on all situations as soon as they came up. I did not have email at the time and she had everything arranged in orderly fashion for me manually done.

To be able to work with a realtor so passionate and dedicated to their industry was an eye opener for me. As a first-time home buyer, I did not know much going into the process. I was quite nervous getting myself into the housing market and if you're from the Lower Mainland, you'll know it's the hottest market in the city.
Heather was able to guide and educate me along each and every step of the way. If you're a first-time home buyer like me, you'll love her First-Time Home Buyer Guidebook.

She went above and beyond, day in and day out, updating me, providing me her honest input and suggestions. Her guidance eased my nervousness and I trusted Heather 100% with one of the largest investments I will ever make in my life. For Heather, her clients needs always come first.

I would like to thank Heather for helping through the purchase and sale of my first property. I was not very familiar with the real estate market and Heather has shared some invaluable knowledge that allowed me to take the right decisions. She was there every step of the way, answering my questions, providing advice and thanks to her it was a smooth and efficient process. Heather did a lot of research, open house visits, and was very invested in making sure I found the right house for me. She is not here just to make a sale but truly cares about her client's satisfaction and will go above and beyond.
It is an absolute pleasure working with Heather; she is extremely professional, organized, knowledgeable and enthusiastic.

I would highly, highly recommend Terry as your realtor, whether buying or selling. Making the decision to move to Kelowna and buy a new home during a pandemic could have been overwhelming. Having Terry (virtually) by my side as my realtor made this a seamless process.

As out of towners, we really needed to trust our agent. Terry came recommended by awesome realtors in North Vancouver who we completely trust so we had confidence in Terry right away. That said, we were still blown away by his service. Terry combined our wish list with his knowledge of the area and what the properties had to offer. He listened and advised us professionally and personably. We now have the most amazing home. We are looking forward to creating so many memories here.

We've known Terry for over 10 years and when it came time for needing a realtor to help sell and buy a property, we didn't hesitate. Terry is incredibly professional and engaging. He sets himself apart in the industry through the use of innovative print and digital marketing tools to help sell your property. He is always on time, available to chat on the phone, via text or in person. When buying and selling real estate that involves large monetary investments, you want someone to take care of the fine details and walk you through the process, and Terry handled this perfectly. He is good at what he does...plain and simple.","09 December, 2019",A Hicks," Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",4.96,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna,"We've known Terry for over 10 years and when it came time for needing a realtor to help sell and buy a property, we didn't hesitate.","when it came time for needing a realtor to help sell and buy a property, we didn't hesitate",0.9990792274475098,comm_real,realtor

Terry helped me purchase my very first property and he has made it a very positive experience for me. Terry is super knowledgeable about the real estate market, the quality of the property and how to negotiate. He gives you the most honest advice and does not rush you to close any deals that do not align with your best interests. As a result, I have avoided lots of bad properties and potentially, bad decisions. Overall, I had a great time dealing with Terry as Terry did a great job in timing the back-and-forth negotiation, and got me a great deal in the end. I also learned a lot about the real estate market and basic knowledge of property inspection from Terry, and during some open house lately, the listing agents even thought that I was a realtor myself... I'd highly recommend Terry to be your agent, and I look forwards to working with him again!","13 June, 2019",Junxian Lu," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna,"I also learned a lot about the real estate market and basic knowledge of property inspection from Terry, and during some open house lately, the listing agents even thought that I was a realtor myself...","during some open house lately, the listing agents even thought that I was a realtor myself",0.594306230545044,comm_real,realtor

Terry was instrumental in a smooth purchase of an apartment near Vancouver on short notice in November 2017. Our cross country move required numerous viewings from a distance using flexible processes (e.g. Skype) and Terry's pre advanced knowledge of the properties my wife and I were viewing was insightful and appreciated. During negotiations and contract completion, Terry answered all our questions professionally which gave us confidence moving forward with the sale. I would definitely use Terry's as my realtor again in the future.

Terry is a professional , kind and knowledgeable realtor. All along the sell and buy he was available, articulate and took the time to understand our needs and help us in the education process , providing tools, material and time. When it came to choices he knew how to listen and respond. When it came to negotiation he always knew when and how to interact.

Terry was referred to me by a mortgage specialist at Scotiabank. I was contacted the next day by Terry and we had a phone conversation that went over every detail about how we were going to market the condo, deciding on a price, taking pictures, open houses and showings. He took professional pictures of the condo and did a detailed price analysis of the building and area to help determine a good price. There was an obstacle in selling, there were power lines that ran very close to the property, which deterred alot of buyers. We had offers and Terry helped in the negotiation process so I could get the best selling price possible. We had three deals fall through due to buyers being able to get financing, and I was losing confidence that my place would sell. Terry was always very positive and confident that it would sell despite the power lines and new mortgage rules for buyers that made it difficult to get financing. He was always very quick in responding to any questions I had, by phonecall, email or text. When my place did sell, he answered all my questions about lawyers, strata and management company termination. I feel very lucky that I had a realtor like Terry that worked very hard and was confident about selling my condo. He was always very professional and friendly. I highly recommend him.","07 February, 2017",Melissa Bourcier," Surrey, British Columbia, Canada",4.96,2021-06-17 09:32:09.605283,2021-06-17 09:32:12.636340,Terry Osti - Vancouver / Kelowna / RE/MAX Kelowna,I feel very lucky that I had a realtor like Terry that worked very hard and was confident about selling my condo.,feel very lucky that I had a realtor like Terry that worked very hard and was confident about selling my condo,0.9957444071769714,comm_real,realtor

This was a challenging time and Terry completely understood and helped make us make this transition as easy as possible by also providing advice and service providers that could assist as well. Terry understood the specific needs that were necessary with the new home and researched the area that was required until the perfect place (with a community workshop) and location was found.

Terry was my realtor when I purchased my first condo and I wasn't about to go to anyone else when I decided to sell it . Everything went as smoothly as expected with Terry at the helm . He listed my condo on every popular social media site , created me my own website with video and spread the word to eveyone he knew . My condo had several hundred views within hours . We had an amazing turn out at open house so I wasn't surprised when it sold after the first weekend of being listed above list price.
With my first condo purchase , I knew what I wanted but had a hard time finding it. Terry didnt push me and lead me away from porperties that were not a good fit for me. With my second purchase , I knew the exact building I wanted to be in and the price I was willing to pay. I looked at him with pleading eyes to get it for me and within days it was mine at the right price !
Terry is the kind of realtor that is with you every step of the way. He listens to your needs , calms your nerves, he is always punctual and always puts you first. He would hold your hand if you needed him to and most important he gets the job done as fast and as painless as possible at the best price ! I wouldn't trust anyone else . He's simply the best and I highly reccomend him without hestiation to everyone I know.
Thanks so much again Terry for all your hard work , keeping me sane and going the extra mile.

I looked at him with pleading eyes to get it for me and within days it was mine at the right price !
Terry is the kind of realtor that is with you every step of the way. He listens to your needs , calms your nerves, he is always punctual and always puts you first. He would hold your hand if you needed him to and most important he gets the job done as fast and as painless as possible at the best price ! I wouldn't trust anyone else . He's simply the best and I highly reccomend him without hestiation to everyone I know.
Thanks so much again Terry for all your hard work , keeping me sane and going the extra mile.

A huge THANK YOU, to the best Realtor in Vancouver, Terry Osti! It sold in less than a week and above asking price! Your professionalism, knowledge, expertise, patience, kindness, calmness, humour, and extra special help made this selling (and buying) experience a positive one. You made it easy. You are so much more than a realtor! You took great care of me, at times being my life-coach, therapist, tissue giver, and jester to help calm my nerves. You always had my back, ensuring that my needs and wants were your top priority. I could always reach you either by email, phone, and text and you always replied quickly and always so kind and friendly! My experience ... amazing! Thank you so much Terry, you're the best!

I can recommend Lynn to any one of my friends and family without hesitation, and anyone thinking about working with a realtor should work with Lynn. Lynn is transparent and honest about any issue or decision and I do not think I could have completed the sale this quickly without her. Even during this pandemic time, Lynn was able to get my property sold within the week it was listed, for exactly what I was asking for, nothing else I could possibly ask for. Lynn also practiced safe COVID protocols to ensure my family was safe and comfortable. Lynn exceeded every expectation I could have. I do not give good reviews lightly and I am certain that anyone who works with Lynn will be more than satisfied with the excellent knowledge, efficiency, and hardworking attitude that Lynn has.","17 November, 2020",Adrian Lee, Coquitlam,5.0,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities","If anyone does not want to read my full review, the next sentence sums up what Lynn is like as a realtor: Lynn is efficient, honest, knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.

Lynn has represented us in three real estate transactions, and we've always been delighted with her service. Most recently, she helped us sell our condo in Vancouver. The photography and video assets she produced for the listing were part of a marketing package that also included search engine optimization, which combined to really make our place stand out from the crowd and generate a lot of traffic to the open houses.

Lynn was an amazing realtor. I was a first time home buyer and had zero knowledge regarding properties. Lynn sat down with me for an hour with no pressure of commitment and explained to me everything I needed to know. Lynn was very genuine and had completed my transaction in a very efficient manner. I would recommend Lynn to anyone I know and would definitely use her in the future when I decide to upgrade or anything property related. Lynn was available by phone and email 24/7 and due to the circumstances of the property I bought, Lynn was able to complete the transaction within days which was what the seller wanted. Although rushed, Lynn still provided me with all the information and was transparent throughout the process. Lynn brought me to a few open houses as well on her own time and set those up within hours and gave honest opinions when she did not like the property. 10/10","15 August, 2018",Adrian Lee," Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada",4.93,2021-06-17 10:13:03.293130,2021-06-17 10:13:06.196771,"Lynn Le Drew PREC* Vancouver, Burnaby, Tri Cities",Lynn was an amazing realtor.,was an amazing realtor,0.9861581325531006,comm_real,realtor

We contacted Lynn through an email. From our first email itself she understood what we were looking for and our expectations. Even though we did not confirm her as our realtor, based on our requirements she kept educating us through emails. Finally we did meet her and she was easy in her approach and very professional. She did represent as well and made prior arrangements with the properties we wanted to see. Even though I guess her area is more core Vancouver, she showed us South Surrey like a Pro. Driving from anything was never an issue for her. The Best thing, She gave us our space. We highly recommend Lynn and being the professional that she is, She adapts to her client's style quickly.

47,"We used Kyle Kerr to buy our home in Victoria this past month. Needless to say he, and the whole PRIME Real Estate team, were outstanding.
Disclaimer: I have known Kyle for some time as we are friends from the same home town, however before choosing a real estate agent, I conducted a lot of research to see who would be the best choice based on the investment they make into selling the property (time and effort, not necessarily financially) and how they promote their listings. The PRIME Real Estate Team stood out as the best Victoria has to offer: their social media presence was strong, and I could tell they put a lot of work into their listings.
I've recommended the PRIME Real Estate Team to everyone I know. Kyle is a true professional and a genuine realtor; this means that he truly loves what he does. He has a great knowledge of the market, is patient, and ultimately finds joy in finding the perfect property for his clients.

She sent us updates on new listings and when we had questions about specific properties she was able to answer out questions and provide background information to help narrow our search.

Lindsie Thomlinson spear fished us a dream from thirty thousand feet and made it a reality and is, in our estimation, one of the greatest people to have ever lived. There are four letter words for people like Lindsie, and one of them is 'Hero'. It's hard to describe just how much of a serious sense of duty of care that Lindsie exhibited at every step of the way in the process, but I will say that it astonished us both the clear eyed seriousness, patience, and deliberate capability that Lindsey exercised at each turn of the Sisiphyean struggle that is navigating the snakepit of the Vancouver real estate market. Lindsie will fight for you, Lindsie will make it happen, and Lindsie will deliver. Lindsie got us our dream home for about 50 grand under our budget. And if that doesn't get your attention then I don't know what does. Buying a home is serious business even if it's not your entire your life savings, and as a professional researcher and analyst I have to say I was astonished at the thoroughness and due diligence that Lindsie employed to find even the slightest hint of red flags that would indicate a risk to our investment. Lindsie went the distance in every respect and that much farther to make sure that we steered clear of significant risk. People say you can't put a price on that, and they would be wrong. I don't think the kind of people who would say that work for their money, but I do, and I bet you do too. Lindsie, underneath her consummate professionalism and cheerful yet diplomatic disposition is a ruthless scrapper that will make the deal happen for you and get you to the front of the line. She had our interests at heart with a determination and zeal that we did not expect but are happy as hell to have on our side. She was, and dare I say it, monklike in her focused and skillful negotiation of the purchase of our property. We were in a situation where someone had delisted the property out of frustration with the market. We were absolutely crushed. Lindsie didn't just get us in the door she took a crowbar to the situation and made it happen and that friends and neighbors is the place that we landed at a price that would make you whistle. Like I said we got it for 50k under our budget, and I'll tell you now we got more value than we expected going into this thing by a mile. That's the thing with Lindsie. She wins. Lindsie's communication is beyond reproach. And by that we mean it's almost scary just how on the ball she is, facilitating and smoothing every last little thing over. Think you should ask her about something? I swear she already knows what you're thinking and you would think she was already wiring her reply before you started writing the text. That's a good thing when you're in this situation. Lindsie doesn't just work for you, she WORKS for you. She did all of this in the midst of the second wave of the pandemic. And she made every single viewing happen like clockwork. Lindsie is also great at protecting you from your worst enemy when you're buying a house: yourself. Anyone wanting to save themselves marriage counselling fees or any amount of grief would be well served to choose Lindsie as their realtor. If you've read this far you're probably asking yourself two questions: why haven't I already started writing a Lindsie an email? And what else is awesome about Lindsie? I can't answer the first question for you. Maybe you don't want to win. But if you do, then you should start writing that email. As far as the second question is concerned the other awesome thing about Lindsie besides the fact that she is one of the most sincere, effective, and driven people I've met is that she's a genuinely good human being. She won one for the good guys for us, and you would choose another realtor at your peril after being cautioned to this effect. I wish you good luck in your housing search, but you'll need a lot less of it with Lindsie on your side. All best.","28 April, 2021",Rob and Angie lutener,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,Anyone wanting to save themselves marriage counselling fees or any amount of grief would be well served to choose Lindsie as their realtor.,would be well served to choose Lindsie as their realtor,-0.9840078353881836,comm_real,realtor

Lindsie was FANTASTIC in helping me with my first property sale. Her professionalism, effort, and communication are top notch. With the Lower Mainland market being very hot at the moment, Lindsie was very patient with me and my family this last few months during the hunt for a property. She clearly takes pride in her work and provides honest feedback and timely responses to help reduce the stress in making your important property decision. She is personable, follows through, and is thorough in explaining each step of the home buying process. I truly respect how Lindsie communicates in a way that does not make you feel pressured to offer more than you are willing. She has a wonderful ability to bridge buyers and sellers and I would recommend her to first time buyers looking for a realtor who will work on your side. Future clients will be lucky to have Lindsie working with you!

We worked with Lindsie when we wanted to make an offer and our realtors were conflicted out due to another client wanting to offer on the same property, and she was amazing. In fact, I specifically asked her to let me know where I could review her excellent service. In a time-sensitive situation, she was exceptionally responsive, communicative, and diligent (on a holiday weekend, no less!). As first-time buyers considering our first-ever offer, we didn't feel ready to offer way over asking price, and she was completely non-pressuring, even though this property seemed certain to receive multiple offers (and did in fact sell for way over asking, just as Lindsie predicted). She listened us and respected our boundaries 100%, while also offering her frank (and correct) assessment of the strategy that would be needed to make our bid successful. We were blown away by how hard she worked for us without much likelihood of being compensated for her time, given that we are not regular clients and were not interested in making a really high offer on this property. Although we had already toured the property with our regular realtors, she made a special appointment to visit the property on her own and look at an area of possible structural concern. She told us that she won't write on a property without having seen it (impressive professional standards!). She also reviewed the strata docs on a tight timeline and offered her knowledgeable, honest take on the building's pros and cons. I appreciate the fact that she is such a frank and clear communicator in an industry where it's tough sometimes to know what you are really getting and how much to read between the lines. Although we worked with Lindsie only briefly, I feel very confident recommending her if you are looking for a realtor who is experienced, forthright, responsive, thorough, and genuinely kind.","07 April, 2021",Alana P,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,"Although we worked with Lindsie only briefly, I feel very confident recommending her if you are looking for a realtor who is experienced, forthright, responsive, thorough, and genuinely kind.","feel very confident recommending her if you are looking for a realtor who is experienced, forthright, responsive, thorough, and genuinely kind",0.9899412989616394,comm_real,realtor

My experience with Lindsie was nothing short of positive in every step of the way. I think what I appreciated most about dealing with her is her realistic approach. She did not promise me the sun, moon and stars, but I knew from our first encounter that she would work tirelessly to do whatever she could within her power to bring offers to me that would exceed my expectations and she did just that!! Within one week I accepted one of 3 offers that was well over asking and I was thrilled! That was on a Monday in late October and by the following Thursday evening the deal was done!! Then came the challenge of finding a new home. Lindsie knew from our many conversations what I was looking for and what my ""deal breakers"" were and from that she scheduled several appointments. The second listing we looked at I knew from the moment I walked in the door that it was exactly what I was looking for. She knew the neighborhood well and thought it would be the perfect location for me. She left my mom and I to continue looking at what I knew with 100% certainty was my new home while she went downstairs to have a chat with the sellers realtor. After we left she did some homework on the area and recent sales and then she called me to discuss and advise what she thought I should offer. I trusted her completely and agreed with her. She then made the call and at that time found out we were in a multiple offer situation. I was on pins a needles until she called me back with the exciting news that they accepted my offer!!! It was a whirlwind from the moment I decided to sell the townhouse I had lived in for 17 years to finding my new home and Lindsie was there every step of the way. There was a mishap with the movers I hired and they damaged the banister when they were moving me out of the old house and I called Lindsie to let her know. She asked me to send her photos of the damage and the moving company's contact info and she took care of it!! I did not expect that but was so relieved when she took that on. Selling and buying new, moving etc during a pandemic was stressful at times and I did encounter a few personal hiccups along the way and Lindsie was there to assist me through the entire process and I was very grateful for that!! I've now been in my new home for about 6 weeks and I LOVE it!!!!

Lindsie is an excellent realtor. We were looking for out-of-town property for about 10 years and have met many realtors in both our selling and buying communities. Lindsie definitely was the cream of the crop and helped us sell our older/small lot Vancouver house during a pandemic for exactly the price we needed - in fact the best price we could have hoped for. Good things about Lindsie: no-pressure, completely understanding and patient and a really nice person. I especially appreciate that she's principled and honest; she won't lie to anyone. But she was also able to get the job done well and on time, keep us focussed, set and meet all deadlines and follow-up on all questions and concerns (and I had a lot), and was always ready to share her considerable knowledge about real estate transactions. At the end she even contacted our lawyer for us to make sure the sale documents were going to go through conveyance on time, when our lawyer was being a bit troublesome. To adapt to the pandemic, she showed our house in sequential appointments for one buyer at a time which was the most labour-intensive for her and the best advantage for us. She was even extra-kind to our vulnerable tenant. It would be hard to list all the things she did as she worked really hard to make the sale and even provided a lot of extra advice to us on our rural purchase in another community when it ended up being very complicated. There were a lot of reasons why we were finally able to move to a stunning rural acreage, but it's also true that without Lindsie I'm not sure it would have happened.

I cannot recommend Lindsie enough to potential buyers who are looking for an incredibly trustworthy, knowledgable and clever realtor. Lindsie represented us as buyers in one of the toughest and most competitive markets - she takes the time to really understand her buyers and we never felt pressure from her. She did; however, know when and how and when to arm us with the kind of competitive edge it takes to nab a dream home in an incredibly competitive market. She is absolutely who you should trust, whether you are buying or selling, to act in your best interests and help you achieve your goals in real estate.","31 August, 2020",Kristen Suess, Eddystone Crescent,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,"I cannot recommend Lindsie enough to potential buyers who are looking for an incredibly trustworthy, knowledgable and clever realtor.","cannot recommend Lindsie enough to potential buyers who are looking for an incredibly trustworthy, knowledgable and clever realtor",0.9893513321876526,comm_real,realtor

Lindsie was instrumental in helping us secure the house of our dreams. After 15 years of living in Vancouver, and with a growing family of 4, we decided to make the move to Kelowna. We knew right away that we wanted Lindsie as our realtor. When we learned that Kelowna was outside her region and that she wouldn't be our real estate agent, we were initially disappointed. But as it turns out, Lindsie was the perfect person to facilitate our move. She immediately got us in touch with an excellent mortgage broker who had us pre-approved within days. She then referred us to an Okanagan-based real estate agent who arranged to do a virtual walk-through of the property 2 days later. After our offer was accepted, Lindsie sent us additional referrals to lawyers and notaries in Vancouver who helped us finalize the sale of the house. Even though Lindsie wasn't our realtor, she ended up facilitating the entire real estate process. Not only is she friendly and professional, all of her referrals were top-notch. We are convinced that without her help, we would not have found our dream home in Kelowna.","15 June, 2020",Priscille B," Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada",5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,We knew right away that we wanted Lindsie as our realtor.,knew right away that we wanted Lindsie as our realtor,0.9928709864616394,comm_real,realtor

In a market like Vancouver, there are a million realtors, and it can be overwhelming to choose one. Its a big decision to make, and an important one, when you are talking millions of dollars. A realtor can either make or break your sale. I knew finding a realtor that was going to meet my expectations would be difficult, since I am told I'm a perfectionist...(insert shy smile here). To top it off, I found myself unexpectedly 5000 miles away from my home of 17 years, so I couldn't even be the hands-on-do-it-your-selfer that I am. It was rough... But choosing Lindsie was the best decision ever, and made the whole ""could be a nightmare situation"" a walk in the park. Lindsie was easy to reach at all times, she knew the market well, she knew what was out there that would compete with my home, and why those places were or weren't selling. Lindsie kept me informed of all happenings, she was updating me daily at times, and went above and beyond when it came to making my home show well. She even used some of her own staging props, and went out and bought a few greens for the barren veggie garden at my request. The write up and photos she had taken were excellent, and if I wanted something tweaked just a bit, I would ask and it would be done. She didn't seem to mind my endless stream of questions and requests and never hesitated to do what she could to facilitate things like letting in house cleaners or repair men. She was always a delight to chat with over the phone and even more delightful when we finally met in person at closing. She was great at adding humour to sometimes stressful situations and by the end of my first ""selling a home experience"" I must admit, I consider Lindsie a friend. :-) When I am ready to sell my other home, Lindsie will be my first call.","10 October, 2018",Claudette M,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,A realtor can either make or break your sale.,A realtor,-0.8468508124351501,comm_real,realtor

Lindsie is a passionate and dedicated real estate realtor. During the time of apartment hunting in Vancouver, she listened to my needs, wants and concerns We worked together for more than two years. As a young professional, I appreciate how she had put together a comprehensive guide to buying your home in Vancouver and gave it to me when we first met at a coffee shop in 2016. She provided me with all the information I needed as a first time home buyer, and I really appreciated the guide - it's informative and concise! Lindsie has guided me through the process and made it a stress-free experience for me. I am grateful for the support I have received and look forward to working with Lindsie again in the near future.","25 February, 2018",Tessa Lynn," British Columbia, Canada",4.93,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,Lindsie is a passionate and dedicated real estate realtor.,is a passionate and dedicated real estate realtor,0.9976292252540588,comm_real,realtor

When it came time to buy a new place and sell our existing one, we did not hesitate at all to reconnect with Lindsie. She provided outstanding guidance and service as first-time buyers, so we fully trusted she would do the same the second time around, and we were not disappointed. We appreciate that Lindsie is honest with us, knows how to ask the right questions (of us and the properties we view), and balances her professionalism with genuine friendliness. With Lindsie's help, we found and bought a new place, easily sold our townhome (for well over asking!), and smoothly transitioned between homes.

Lindsie is a fantastic realtor and an even better person! She took the time out to get to know us, our needs and dreams. After coming second in two bidding wars Lindsie took the time to sit down with us, refocus our approach and make sure we were all on the same page. When it came to our eventual purchase we got our dream home and at a great price.

Lindsie represented us in the purchase of our house in Vancouver. She was flexible and accommodating with arranging viewings and providing feedback and advice. When we found the house we wanted to buy her biggest talents became apparent: she is a master at deal-making, and she devised a strategy to get us the best outcome from the situation (helping us to avoid a bidding war), then managed us and the seller's agent to execute it. Most impressive of all, she carefully managed the flow of information to us so as not to overwhelm us, or allow our emotions to get the better of us. Even the seller's agent told us what an excellent realtor we had. I cannot recommend her work more highly, and will definitely use her for our next real estate transaction.","07 January, 2018",Natalie Tsang,,5.0,2021-06-17 12:16:01.328860,2021-06-17 12:16:04.182911,Lindsie Tomlinson,Even the seller's agent told us what an excellent realtor we had.,told us what an excellent realtor we had,0.8865563869476318,comm_real,realtor

She made us feel supported and heard through the whole process, and we just knew she had our best interest in mind. Her knowledge of the building we were interested in was very important for us and she left no questions unanswered.

Honesty and integrity were the two most important characteristics I wanted in a realtor when I was selling my condo, looking for another and then subsequently buying. Not only did Lindsie fulfill my top criteria in every segment of the journey, but she also demonstrated other important skills such as experience, knowledge of the market and negotiation. She was reliable, accessible (promptly returned texts, phone calls, showed up on time for showings/meetings) and professional. Her friendly, personable patient manner made me feel comfortable asking any question. She also really listened to what I wanted, so time was not wasted looking at properties that were not suitable.

36,"We came to Brian via a recommendation from our friends but no idea what to expect when we first contacted him as we had no knowledge of the Canadian housing market and had not spoken to any other realtors in the Vancouver area. Brian immediately made us feel comfortable and safe with both his friendliness and knowledge not only of the housing market but also of the house purchase process, and gave us a step by step guide of what we could expect through this process. Brian was able to help us articluate what we were looking for in a house, what areas we were interested in living in and what our budget was so he could search for suitable properties, and over a very short period of time was able to show us properties meeting our needs and then tune his search for properties based on our feedback on what worked and did not work for us from the property viewing he had organised for us. Within a month Brian had found our ideal home for us that matched not only most of our housing ammenity needs but was also in the location we wanted (but did not think we could afford) and gave us great value for our square footage! Not an easy task when you are trying to find a reasonable priced and sized home for a family of four in Kitsilano! Brian was outstanding through our bid process and was in communication with us almost hourly every step of the way! No time was too late or too early for him to be talking to us and the seller's realtor to submit offers and negotiate counter offers, offering freindly advice to us on how to respond based on his experience in the market as well as his professional relationships with most of the local realtors in the Vancouver area. Brian was also able to offer us advice (at our request) on who to speak to regarding mortgage and insurance options, housing inspections and appraisals as well as legal services which made this normally very stressful process much more managable and easy. They say that moving house is one of the top three most stressful things you can do in your life but with Brian's help and guidance through this process we are genuinely excited to be moving into the home of our dreams! Thank you so much to you and Stephen for everything you have done for us.

We have been dealing with our realtor, Eva Li, since 1990. She helped us to sell our older home in Vancouver when our youngest child was just a month old; and then helped us to buy a newer house in a prime location. Later on, she also listed and sold my mother's house at an excellent price, in Vancouver East. Furthermore, 6 years ago, when we were ready for an investment property, with the help of Eva's good advice, we purchased a house in North Burnaby for rental. Eva is professional, kind, and always made us feel comfortable while we worked with her. She is very knowledgeable with the market conditions, and provided excellent service. Eva took care of all the details in our real estate needs during the selling and buying process. We would highly recommend Eva Li to all our friends and relatives!

I chose Karson as my realtor as his assistant, who is Korean, could help me with better translation and understanding, and ultimately as Karson previously dealt complicated real-estate problem successfully from a friend of mine. It was the first time purchasing, which made things a little confusing and complicated in the beginning, but fortunately Karson was able to walkthrough the process step by step, with a level of detail I appreciated. Karson Wong is a very professional real estate agent. He doesn't hesitate to help his client at the time that is most convenient and needed, and willingly reaches out further to give extra helpful information that is beneficial to acknowledge. During the meetings he always take a moment to give you chance to ask any question that comes to mind or remind any details that are good to know. What I appreciated about dealing with Karson was that he is thorough. There was one time he brought a Gopro camera during the inspection to record all the details that happened during the inspection, and later sent video link. It was helpful as those are easily forgettable. I would recommend Karson's services to my friend or anyone that is looking to involve in real-estate dealing. If you feel like your experience or knowledge in real-estate is not as good, especially for first time buyers like myself, you will appreciate the level of detail that he will go through to ensure that you meet your expectation.","13 November, 2020",Anna Lee,,5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong,"I chose Karson as my realtor as his assistant, who is Korean, could help me with better translation and understanding, and ultimately as Karson previously dealt complicated real-estate problem successfully from a friend of mine.","chose Karson as my realtor as his assistant, who is Korean, could help me with better translation and understanding, and ultimately as Karson previously dealt complicated real-estate problem successfully from a friend of mine",0.9972217082977295,comm_real,realtor
9,"Karson is a diligent and a punctual thorough professional. I met Karson through a common friend (who is a realtor in Calgary) while I was looking to buy a new home in Vancouver Area. I knew the area that I wanted to buy a property. In our first meeting, which, due to COVID, was a telephonic one, I explained Karson what exactly we (my wife and I) were looking for. Karson regularly sent us details of the properties that matched our requirements, till we found the one that we loved. During this time, he helped us look at multiple properties and with every 'showing' he was able to understand our requirements better. During the final transactions, we were out of town. He liaised with the home inspector and got the home inspection done and then held a live video conference to let us know the result. He made a video of entire home inspection and then sent it to us. He went above and beyond to ensure that our absence did not impact our decision. Karson is a trustworthy and reliable realtor who works in the interest of his clients. I recommend him to anyone who is looking to buy a property in Vancouver Area, especially if you are busy and can not run around to do the leg work. Overall, I would rate him 10/10.","08 November, 2020",Bandhul Mishra,,5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong,I met Karson through a common friend (who is a realtor in Calgary) while I was looking to buy a new home in Vancouver Area.,met Karson through a common friend (who is a realtor in Calgary) while I was looking to buy a new home in Vancouver Area,0.9940892457962036,comm_real,realtor

19,"Being an owner of various properties in the lower mainland. I have worked with a number of Realtors across different companies. Working with Karson from Remax was a great experience for my last purchase. He was by far the most attentive to details and efficient to work with, and always a phone call away to my needs. While I considered myself an experienced owner and investor, I always appreciate Karson's tips and knowledge throughout the entire experience of the purchase. I think being a successful realtor not only means able to sell and close your sale, but really understand the clients' needs and able to offer exceptional service through the whole purchasing journey. If you are looking to work with someone like that I would recommend Karson!","07 November, 2019",Julian Hui,,5.0,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong,"I think being a successful realtor not only means able to sell and close your sale, but really understand the clients' needs and able to offer exceptional service through the whole purchasing journey.","think being a successful realtor not only means able to sell and close your sale, but really understand the clients' needs and able to offer exceptional service through the whole purchasing journey",0.9973561763763428,comm_real,realtor
27,"I would describe my overall experience with Karson's service to be excellent. My thoughts about Karson's personality is that he is very responsible, organized, and hard working. Being a overseas purchaser, i was impossible for me to be present to visit the open houses. However, Karson would visit open houses for us along with taking video recordings of the house as well as videos of the surroundings of the buildings and roads. Also, Karson would give professional advices on pricing as he is familiar with different prices in different areas( Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Richmond, White Rock.). I choose Karson as my realtor because I trust him as a professional. He is responsible and he would give advices based on the fundamentals of investments and weighting out the pros and cons of each investment. I appreciate most as a client when dealing with Karson is his work ethnic. I would recommend Karon's services to my friends because he is a professional that can be trusted.","20 August, 2018",Chi Ho Hui," British Columbia, Canada",4.87,2021-06-17 15:05:22.501897,2021-06-17 15:05:25.207616,Karson Wong,I choose Karson as my realtor because I trust him as a professional.,choose Karson as my realtor because I trust him as a professional,0.9992867112159729,comm_real,realtor
