the sales agent was clear but curt i did appreciate that they did not attempt to follow up with me when i delayed for a significant period when i did eventually confirm that i was moving forward we scheduled a call for sales onboarding this call was entirely too rushed i could barely follow what the agent was talking about as we walked through the product user interface which isnt a great feeling after youve finally pulled the trigger after careful and thorough research
following this i was handed off to a customer support representative dedicated to onboarding this person was definitely less curt but she failed to correctly enter the type of packaging that i wanted to use for my product and the web app has limited ability to enter certain information about your product including what kind of package you want to use thats something id love to have control over i definitely dont want to be reaching out to customer support when something like that changes as a result a heavier package was used and the shipping cost increased once you finish your onboarding with shiphero you can only contact customer support through the chat widget within the app so i began communicating with the to fix the problem
my experience with inapp customer support has been soso they say 20 minute average response time but ive experiencing nothing shorter than 24 hour responses it may not help that im in a timezone outside of the us my interactions with these support agents have also been quite curt though they did eventually solve the problem however the pricing on the shiphero website is not clear when your unit weight is around 1lb apparently anything from 15oz to 16oz is rounded up to a pound which i could not find clear language around on the pricing page so now im paying more than i initially calculated for shipping which was part of the reason why i chose shiphero
all that aside my experience with sending inventory is so far smooth and the product is going out to customers as expected in reality this is the most important part of their business so i do appreciate that things are working correctly but my interactions with customer support have definitely left much to be desired i hope that as time moves forward my impression will continue to improve its just a bit of a shame that my first impression is a bit murky",2021-04-11T04:07:32.000Z,3,0,Jordan,2.0,2021-05-28 12:49:08.954908,2021-05-28 12:49:09.135818,['i reviewed the myriad choices for 3rd party fulfillment direct to customer after extensive analysis of price and reviews i landed on shiphero i was attracted to the idea of zoneless postage pricing and found the company voice to be clear and concise i reached out and started a conversation with their sales team\nthe sales agent was clear but curt i did appreciate that they did not attempt to follow up with me when i delayed for a significant period when i did eventually confirm that i was moving forward we scheduled a call for sales onboarding this call was entirely too rushed i could barely follow what the agent was talking about as we walked through the product user interface which isnt a great feeling after youve finally pulled the trigger after careful and thorough research\nfollowing this i was handed off to a customer support representative dedicated to onboarding this person was definitely less curt but she failed to correctly enter the type of packaging that i wanted to use for my product and the web app has limited ability to enter certain information about your product including what kind of package you want to use thats something id love to have control over i definitely dont want to be reaching out to customer support when something like that changes as a result a heavier package was used and the shipping cost increased once you finish your onboarding with shiphero you can only contact customer support through the chat widget within the app so i began communicating with the to fix the problem\nmy experience with inapp customer support has been soso they say 20 minute average response time but ive experiencing nothing shorter than 24 hour responses it may not help that im in a timezone outside of the us my interactions with these support agents have also been quite curt though they did eventually solve the problem however the pricing on the shiphero website is not clear when your unit weight is around 1lb apparently anything from 15oz to 16oz is rounded up to a pound which i could not find clear language around on the pricing page so now im paying more than i initially calculated for shipping which was part of the reason why i chose shiphero\nall that aside my experience with sending inventory is so far smooth and the product is going out to customers as expected in reality this is the most important part of their business so i do appreciate that things are working correctly but my interactions with customer support have definitely left much to be desired i hope that as time moves forward my impression will continue to improve its just a bit of a shame that my first impression is a bit murky'],[],[],[],"i reviewed the myriad choices for 3rd party fulfillment direct to customer after extensive analysis of price and reviews i landed on shiphero i was attracted to the idea of zoneless postage pricing and found the company voice to be clear and concise i reached out and started a conversation with their sales team

all that aside my experience with sending inventory is so far smooth and the product is going out to customers as expected in reality this is the most important part of their business so i do appreciate that things are working correctly but my interactions with customer support have definitely left much to be desired i hope that as time moves forward my impression will continue to improve its just a bit of a shame that my first impression is a bit murky",0.11947751322751324,"['shipping', packaging]",shipping,packaging

unfortunately i have to knock down three stars after a few months since i found several issues with the fulfillment process
first if you work with shopify and you intend to sell part of your catalog using ship hero bear in mind that the app will display all store products and orders for example if you have 500 skus and use shiphero to sell 60 the panel will display all store orders mixed inventories making it extremely difficult to track orders the filters wont work as intended in my case the engineers suggested deleting all non shiphero products manually within the app which is pointless since they sync daily repeatedly and it is very timeconsuming to delete products daily
secondly the packaging rules were set wrongly instead of using our custom packages we had dozens of orders shipped using shiphero packaging which increased the shipping cost substantially losing profit from these orders no compensation was offered but an apology thank god we checked the invoices and found out
finally the eventual mistakes will happen not shipping an order in time due to operator error which is okay but you will need to eat up the cost or customers negative feedback there is no responsibility on shipheros end at all

first if you work with shopify and you intend to sell part of your catalog using ship hero bear in mind that the app will display all store products and orders for example if you have 500 skus and use shiphero to sell 60 the panel will display all store orders mixed inventories making it extremely difficult to track orders the filters wont work as intended in my case the engineers suggested deleting all non shiphero products manually within the app which is pointless since they sync daily repeatedly and it is very timeconsuming to delete products daily
secondly the packaging rules were set wrongly instead of using our custom packages we had dozens of orders shipped using shiphero packaging which increased the shipping cost substantially losing profit from these orders no compensation was offered but an apology thank god we checked the invoices and found out
finally the eventual mistakes will happen not shipping an order in time due to operator error which is okay but you will need to eat up the cost or customers negative feedback there is no responsibility on shipheros end at all
i have to say that the support is still fast and reliable i just wished i knew all of this in advance before sending our products here",0.07849794238683128,"['custom', packaging]",custom,packaging
41,603a6419f85d7509d8e63b07,Could be better,IE,"i have been sending shipments with this company for a few days and so far i have been pleased the communication is fantastic and they fulfill incredibly fast
carina is simply great this level of support is what all good companies should aim for its almost like having a personal advisor thank you carina <3

first if you work with shopify and you intend to sell part of your catalog using ship hero bear in mind that the app will display all store products and orders for example if you have 500 skus and use shiphero to sell 60 the panel will display all store orders mixed inventories making it extremely difficult to track orders the filters wont work as intended in my case the engineers suggested deleting all non shiphero products manually within the app which is pointless since they sync daily repeatedly and it is very timeconsuming to delete products daily
secondly the packaging rules were set wrongly instead of using our custom packages we had dozens of orders shipped using shiphero packaging which increased the shipping cost substantially losing profit from these orders no compensation was offered but an apology thank god we checked the invoices and found out
finally the eventual mistakes will happen not shipping an order in time due to operator error which is okay but you will need to eat up the cost or customers negative feedback there is no responsibility on shipheros end at all

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews
shipbob is a scam avoid

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

heres snippets of my gross experience with shipbob and what you can expect
firstly if i did not have some inventory available at another fulfillment center shipbob wouldve stopped my business for an entire month
shipbob stole some of my inventory they claimed the missing inventory is because their warehouse doesnt know how to count not kidding they said that sometimes they just count incorrectly this was during a recorded call on august 14 2020 mentioning dates cause they love to contact trustpilot denying their incompetence
i requested credit for the stolen inventory and after receiving my inventory and seeing how careless theyve handled it i doubt that is gonna happen
i asked for a video recording to see the state of my inventory because i absolutely no longer trust them they denied the request i was correct
hidden fees they told me kitting would cost $110 per item and charged me $250 without informing me of the cost change when i asked about this no response email from august 21 2020
customer support is a hit or miss leaning very strongly towards miss
your emails will be ignored
your calls will end with a promise that someone will follow up they wont
you will spend many many many hours calling and emailing asking people to do their job
your orders will not be sent out on time
your kitting will never be ready on time
i was going to do a preorder sale through shipbob and did a test for 5 f i v e orders with shipbob and it took them over 2 weeks to ship five orders
when i brought up how awful their service is i was told that as we work with over 4000 merchants unfortunately this does happen rarely from time to time email from aug 14 2020 sooo am i automatically just part of the whatever this happens group will you be part of that group
you have to pay $500 for an implementation specialist who will respond maybeif they feel like it days later with no solution to your problem because they are busy with more important back to back meetings email from aug 3 2020
do not become hopeful when they offer to set up a call for you with management it literally just means someone in customer support with a fancy title will show up to a call they will do nothing
management only shows upis available for a call when youve voiced that youre leaving the company
once you speak with management youll meet a new layer of shipbob incompetency
management will have a call with you and then ghost you literally never talk to you again
when i directly called them a scam which they are they informed me that one of their clients is tom brady instagram dm august 25 2020 still trying to figure out who this impressed in the past that they felt a need to mention it to me tom bradyelohel
their 5star reviews are clearly fake they deleted mine and other negative comments on instagram and have disabled reviews on facebook i reposted my ig comment on trustpilot they always seem to receive sparkling reviews right after an authentic negative review and theyre constantly reporting reviews for breaching guidelines
maybe if they spent more time doing their job they wouldnt have to spend time making up and disputing reviews

134,5e6273153c93ae0bc4115083,I've waited before reviewing ShipBob,DE,"ive waited before reviewing shipbob as i think its a great concept but the last experience with them has really drawn the line
we sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their texas warehouse to test the shipbob service in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there we currently have 2 warehouses in europe which we manage ourselves and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment
now before you get on shipbob says that the negotiated the best shipping rates so that you dont have to worry about it this sounds great and honnestly we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment however it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all
our product is a mediumsized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions 20x20x20 the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item
now the average fulfillment cost inside the us for these items is $150 per box $150
however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive
but the reason why i am now writing this review is that we just had our first return the fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $1379 and now shipbob charged us $936 for the return of this lamp
thats a total of $2315 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp
how on earth
in our own warehouses in europe we have a flat return rate of 8eur smallmedium items and 12eur for larger items and i am sure that its the same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel
i really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it
there are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over x10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is
just do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20x20x20 and try to get it shipped from one city in texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs
or try to send the same 20x20x20 parcel from texas to ny including a return label and try to justify the $2315 charge
update i thought it would be very interesting to add the following our offices are located in berlin germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices
shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that i mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from china
how on earth is it possible that shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the us then express air shipping from china to germany
new update this keeps on getting better shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client and it arrived severely damaged shipping cost from texas to ny $140 their response to this is that shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return this lamp to shipbob

$80 for it\njust to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard

same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel\ni really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it\nthere are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over x10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is\njust do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20x20x20 and try to get it shipped from one city in texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs\nor try to send the same 20x20x20 parcel from texas to ny including a return label and try to justify the $2315 charge\nupdate i thought it would be very interesting to add the following our offices are located in berlin germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices\nshipping a single box the size of that table lamp that i mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from china\nhow on earth is it possible that shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the us then express air shipping from china to germany\nnew update this keeps on getting better shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client and it arrived severely damaged shipping cost from texas to ny $140 their response to this is that shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return

we sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their texas warehouse to test the shipbob service in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there we currently have 2 warehouses in europe which we manage ourselves and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment
now before you get on shipbob says that the negotiated the best shipping rates so that you dont have to worry about it this sounds great and honnestly we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment however it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all
our product is a mediumsized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions 20x20x20 the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item
now the average fulfillment cost inside the us for these items is $150 per box $150
however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive

shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return this lamp to shipbob for which they will charge us another $90 this is just the absolute worst company i have ever dealt with and i am looking forward to our stock being over with them shipbob also claims to be a us company but only has support overseas'],"ive waited before reviewing shipbob as i think its a great concept but the last experience with them has really drawn the line
we sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their texas warehouse to test the shipbob service in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there we currently have 2 warehouses in europe which we manage ourselves and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment
now before you get on shipbob says that the negotiated the best shipping rates so that you dont have to worry about it this sounds great and honnestly we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment however it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all
our product is a mediumsized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions 20x20x20 the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item
now the average fulfillment cost inside the us for these items is $150 per box $150
however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive
but the reason why i am now writing this review is that we just had our first return the fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $1379 and now shipbob charged us $936 for the return of this lamp
thats a total of $2315 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp
how on earth
in our own warehouses in europe we have a flat return rate of 8eur smallmedium items and 12eur for larger items and i am sure that its the same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel
i really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it

shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return this lamp to shipbob for which they will charge us another $90 this is just the absolute worst company i have ever dealt with and i am looking forward to our stock being over with them shipbob also claims to be a us company but only has support overseas'],"ive waited before reviewing shipbob as i think its a great concept but the last experience with them has really drawn the line
we sent 50 pieces of one of our products to their texas warehouse to test the shipbob service in the hope to store larger inventory and more products there we currently have 2 warehouses in europe which we manage ourselves and are familiar with shipping rates and fulfillment
now before you get on shipbob says that the negotiated the best shipping rates so that you dont have to worry about it this sounds great and honnestly we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment however it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all
our product is a mediumsized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions 20x20x20 the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item
now the average fulfillment cost inside the us for these items is $150 per box $150
however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive
but the reason why i am now writing this review is that we just had our first return the fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $1379 and now shipbob charged us $936 for the return of this lamp
thats a total of $2315 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp
how on earth
in our own warehouses in europe we have a flat return rate of 8eur smallmedium items and 12eur for larger items and i am sure that its the same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel
i really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it
there are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over x10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is
just do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20x20x20 and try to get it shipped from one city in texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs
or try to send the same 20x20x20 parcel from texas to ny including a return label and try to justify the $2315 charge
update i thought it would be very interesting to add the following our offices are located in berlin germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices
shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that i mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from china

now before you get on shipbob says that the negotiated the best shipping rates so that you dont have to worry about it this sounds great and honnestly we are ready to pay a good amount for the service of fulfillment however it seems like there is no justification for their charges at all
our product is a mediumsized table lamp packed in a parcel with the following dimensions 20x20x20 the products are all packed and ready to be shipped absolutely nothing needs to be done other than ship the item
now the average fulfillment cost inside the us for these items is $150 per box $150
however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive
but the reason why i am now writing this review is that we just had our first return the fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $1379 and now shipbob charged us $936 for the return of this lamp
thats a total of $2315 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp
how on earth
in our own warehouses in europe we have a flat return rate of 8eur smallmedium items and 12eur for larger items and i am sure that its the same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel
i really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it
there are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over x10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is
just do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20x20x20 and try to get it shipped from one city in texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs
or try to send the same 20x20x20 parcel from texas to ny including a return label and try to justify the $2315 charge
update i thought it would be very interesting to add the following our offices are located in berlin germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices
shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that i mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from china
how on earth is it possible that shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the us then express air shipping from china to germany
new update this keeps on getting better shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client and it arrived severely damaged shipping cost from texas to ny $140 their response to this is that shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return this lamp to shipbob for which they will charge us another $90 this is just the absolute worst company i have ever dealt with and i am looking forward to our stock being over with them shipbob also claims to be a us company but only has support overseas",0.185793923058074,"['also', packaging]",also,packaging

however the order that really caught my attention was an order that had to be shipped from the warehouse in texas to a customer in dallas texas this is a 4h driver from the warehouse the shipping had been done with economy ground shipping and shipbob charged us $8063 for it now for a company that claims to have the best shipping rates how on earth is it possible to ship an item using an economy ground shipping service within the same state and charged over $80 for it
just to give you an example we send out chairs from our european warehouses to customers in europe these chairs have almost double the size of packaging then this table lamp a standard shipping fee for this from berlin to spain is around 18eur note that berlin to spain is a 24h drive
but the reason why i am now writing this review is that we just had our first return the fulfillment cost for a single table lamp was $1379 and now shipbob charged us $936 for the return of this lamp
thats a total of $2315 for the shipping and return for 1 table lamp
how on earth
in our own warehouses in europe we have a flat return rate of 8eur smallmedium items and 12eur for larger items and i am sure that its the same in the us and am fairly convinced that its even cheaper as everything stays in the same country but $936 for a single return of a mediumsized parcel
i really didnt want to write this review this is completely absurd shipbob has been taking all of the profit that we made on this item and this return item has resulted in an incredible loss on it
there are no justifications for their prices whatsoever and based on my experience with our own warehouses and shipping rates they charge over x10 what the cost of the shipping of an item is
just do the math for yourself try to find a rate for the shipping of a parcel with the dimensions 20x20x20 and try to get it shipped from one city in texas to another city in the same state and then try to see how much shipping costs
or try to send the same 20x20x20 parcel from texas to ny including a return label and try to justify the $2315 charge
update i thought it would be very interesting to add the following our offices are located in berlin germany and we often ship samples for potential products for our different brands to our offices
shipping a single box the size of that table lamp that i mentioned in the review costs us about $130 with the express door to door air shipping from china
how on earth is it possible that shipbob has rates that are higher for economy ground shipping within the us then express air shipping from china to germany
new update this keeps on getting better shipbob shipped this table lamp to a client and it arrived severely damaged shipping cost from texas to ny $140 their response to this is that shipbob does not take any responsibility for the damages what for $140 there is no insurance included and shipbob does not take any responsibility for damages this means that we now need to return this lamp to shipbob for which they will charge us another $90 this is just the absolute worst company i have ever dealt with and i am looking forward to our stock being over with them shipbob also claims to be a us company but only has support overseas",0.185793923058074,"['overseas', packaging]",overseas,packaging

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob

shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer

emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money

well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing

reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money

i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs

emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob

well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately

they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs

shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer

reluctant to refund that money

well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob

well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful

initially they were ok to get my account going but not long after their sheer incompetence and untrustworthiness became apparent
my company sells simple ecommerce products often in multipacks their total inability to simply pack a 2unit or 3unit multipack into a prepackaged unit and have it shipped as requested is staggering
i would have telephoned over 5 times with just one such situation and it took hours before i even received a call back and then that call was from a warehouse not involved in this order
they routinely overcharge orders are placed into overly excessive packaging for one order then into different appropriate packaging for the next exact same order at times i have been invoiced $11 for an order that should have cost $56 this happened as often as not
the webinterface is clunky and buggy
only just now has a merchant care telephone number been setup its hit or miss as to whether someone answers
emails requesting help particularly refunds to your account after their overcharging routinely go unanswered or if answered then unresolved typical answer that order was too long ago we did an audit but unfortunately we cannot refund your money
and then there is this doozy overcharging $1400 yes usd $1400 and then delaying in the refund of that money
well credit your account they say i dont want a credit i want that money refunded you dont keep my money ahead of time shipbob messed up shipbob should refund immediately
we are unable to refund your credit card they say they are very quick to charge your credit card but to say they cant reverse a charge i smell bs
well look into this and get onto it as soon as possible still 23 weeks later and notoneword on refunding me my money
this will have to be resolved through local police fraud department i believe
shipbob are wholly uninterested in doing the right thing by a 3year loyal existing customer
happy to charge $1400 when not supposed to do so
reluctant to refund that money
flat out refused to refund money overcharged for excessive shipping costs this is theft
everyone please at all cost stay away from shipbob
juststayaway
shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

shipbob simply are that bad
update it appears that any negative review of shipbob is attempted to be taken down off trustpilot by claiming it is not genuine trustpilot then requests from reviewer information to prove your business had interactions with shipbob a number of folks may consider this a waste of their time and so not bother which likely means there are more dissatisfied customers than the ones reviewing
i took the time and submitted the info requested i felt it necessary to warn others
as youll see all the negative reviews are verified customers
now ask yourself how many of the glowing 5star reviews show verified customer
it could well be a case of fake 5star reviews being uploaded trustpilot you should require all reviewers to be verified
and finally this when issues arise and they do frequently the customer service is woeful and takes many days to just reply to your email let alone getting your issue resolved they are very quick to ask you for a review and tell us how were doing
well i am telling you how youre doing disgraceful
that said i hope this review has been useful and will help others avoid the angst and endless stress of using shipbob

the experience with shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars the bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake when you file a claim there is no claim or confirmation they rcvd your claim it just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again its very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake here are just a few examples of problems that weve had where they refuse to take responsibility
1 shipping product that isnt our we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product
2 shipping in the wrong packaging we setup customer packaging so some of our products would ship in polymailers they told us this was set up and for a while it was working for for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20x20x12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $700 we even worked with one of their vps to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok
3taking months to fulfill wholesale orders if you need to send items to amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it it takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4 not able to fulfill amazon fbm they repeatedly missed the deadline causing our amazon account to go into highrisk and nearly being shut down
5 took 2 months to fulfill ecommerce orders we all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of january 10 we still have orders from black friday that have not been fulfilled to make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on thanksgiving that just arrived this week and shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order

the experience with shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars the bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake when you file a claim there is no claim or confirmation they rcvd your claim it just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again its very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake here are just a few examples of problems that weve had where they refuse to take responsibility
1 shipping product that isnt our we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product
2 shipping in the wrong packaging we setup customer packaging so some of our products would ship in polymailers they told us this was set up and for a while it was working for for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20x20x12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $700 we even worked with one of their vps to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok
3taking months to fulfill wholesale orders if you need to send items to amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it it takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4 not able to fulfill amazon fbm they repeatedly missed the deadline causing our amazon account to go into highrisk and nearly being shut down
5 took 2 months to fulfill ecommerce orders we all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of january 10 we still have orders from black friday that have not been fulfilled to make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on thanksgiving that just arrived this week and shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order

the experience with shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars the bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake when you file a claim there is no claim or confirmation they rcvd your claim it just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again its very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake here are just a few examples of problems that weve had where they refuse to take responsibility
1 shipping product that isnt our we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product
2 shipping in the wrong packaging we setup customer packaging so some of our products would ship in polymailers they told us this was set up and for a while it was working for for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20x20x12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $700 we even worked with one of their vps to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok
3taking months to fulfill wholesale orders if you need to send items to amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it it takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4 not able to fulfill amazon fbm they repeatedly missed the deadline causing our amazon account to go into highrisk and nearly being shut down
5 took 2 months to fulfill ecommerce orders we all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of january 10 we still have orders from black friday that have not been fulfilled to make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on thanksgiving that just arrived this week and shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order

the experience with shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars the bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake when you file a claim there is no claim or confirmation they rcvd your claim it just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again its very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake here are just a few examples of problems that weve had where they refuse to take responsibility
1 shipping product that isnt our we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product
2 shipping in the wrong packaging we setup customer packaging so some of our products would ship in polymailers they told us this was set up and for a while it was working for for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20x20x12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $700 we even worked with one of their vps to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok
3taking months to fulfill wholesale orders if you need to send items to amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it it takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4 not able to fulfill amazon fbm they repeatedly missed the deadline causing our amazon account to go into highrisk and nearly being shut down
5 took 2 months to fulfill ecommerce orders we all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of january 10 we still have orders from black friday that have not been fulfilled to make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on thanksgiving that just arrived this week and shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order

the experience with shipmonk has been a nightmare to say the least and has cost my business thousands of dollars the bottom line is they refuse to issue a refund when they make a mistake when you file a claim there is no claim or confirmation they rcvd your claim it just goes into a mysterious black hole and you never hear about the issue again its very clear after talking to their management that they have a strict policy of not refunding customers when they make a mistake here are just a few examples of problems that weve had where they refuse to take responsibility
1 shipping product that isnt our we had customers complaining they rcvd random products that were not even our companies shipmonk has refused to take responsibility even though we submitted claims showing the photos of the incorrect product
2 shipping in the wrong packaging we setup customer packaging so some of our products would ship in polymailers they told us this was set up and for a while it was working for for the past month instead of shipping in the correct package they decided to ship in massive 20x20x12 boxes which increased our cost by 7 times now every package they ship costs $49 instead of $700 we even worked with one of their vps to set up the custom packaging and had their assurances all was ok
3taking months to fulfill wholesale orders if you need to send items to amazon in a timely matter you can forget about it it takes their wholesale team literally months to send out a case to amazon or other wholesale account
4 not able to fulfill amazon fbm they repeatedly missed the deadline causing our amazon account to go into highrisk and nearly being shut down
5 took 2 months to fulfill ecommerce orders we all knew there would be delays during the holiday but as of january 10 we still have orders from black friday that have not been fulfilled to make matters worse we have to offer refunds for products that were ordered on thanksgiving that just arrived this week and shipmonk is refusing to pay because they say they fulfilled the order

got through it and was smooth sailing so we thought until the freight charges started getting adjusted by the shipping companies turns out what shipmonk call 09 lb is actually 105 lb so our freight rates effectively doubled which destroyed our margins
we soldiered on but eventually grew tired of all the nickel and diming with 4 surcharges on all account payment methods except ach payments ridiculous packaging material charges for standard size cartons and void fill which should be part of the pick n pack fee and high storage fees due to the way they spread your stock out
