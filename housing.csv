289,Eat shop & play,,"Granville island is a foodie playground. The trip over by the acqua bus is beautiful and reasonably priced. You can access the island via car or by foot. So the food kiosks are amazing housed in a wearhouse type structure. You can eat quality foods of all types as well as bakeries, amazing breads, cheeses, gelato. Not enough seating especially on weekends very crowded. If you can visit on a week day much more enjoyable. Prices are not overly excessive considering it's a tourist destination. If kiosks aren't your preference for eating there are several sit down quality restaurants of all prices. Some examples I've tried are Kegs, Sandbar, Bridges and Vancouver seafood and fish house. Great seafood, fresh fish and steak. Picture taking views as well as happy hour. After your food fill there are shops to browse but you'll pay tourist prices. There is a huge structure for kids but noisy. If it's raining you can easily keep them busy. Granville also offers a theater with very entertaining productions reasonably priced. A plus it's one of the rare attractions that always has cabs waiting.

1242,"Previously a Vancouver favourite, but pay parking has taken over",,"This was a go-to family favourite in Vancouver: great place to bring kids for lunch and a stop by Kids Only Market and a regular shopping place for fresh produce and some specialty groceries (Duso's, Oyama etc). With free parking we'd often drop by after work on a whim to grab bread from Terra or pick up dinner to-go from a stall. It was often busy, but with so many people coming in and out I never failed to get a parking spot without much of a wait (at most maybe 3-5 minutes; even at the weekend I can't say I ever left for lack of parking). Went today to find pay parking had been put in place everywhere (cash grab?). I would normally grab a coffee with friends and then browse for groceries and maybe some new spices or things to try, but it was hard to estimate how much time I'd need and waiting in line at the vendors just drove home that I was paying for the privilege of being in line.I guess I'll come back for special occasion shopping (although there's no way I'm paying for parking during the December queues at Oyama; too bad, it was great food), but won't be stopping by to pick up Terra or a papaya salad just because I'm in the neighbourhood anymore, and will definitely replace it as a coffee spot with friends with somewhere free to park. It's a nightmare to take public transit to the market from my house, particularly while carrying groceries, so I think I just won't be coming like I used to :(Huge disappointment.

1450,Not an island but still a fun-land,,"Food choices plus boats and the waters. Add families and friends and visitors. This is the essence of Granville Island, one of the iconic stops in Vancouver. Correction: it's actually a peninsula despite its name. To reach there, a public transportation option from downtown Vancouver (Gastown) is Bus #50. Get off from the stop at the intersection of Anderson St. and West 2nd Ave. Walk from here until you spot the enormous ""Granville Island"" sign. You'll start seeing boats, shops, studios, restaurants and the like but you can go further. Then there's the Public Market, a one-story expanse of a building which, upon entering, houses booths selling baked goodies, seafood offerings, veggies and fruits, juice and drink mixes and other local produce. People, locals and outsiders, mill around so expect the atmosphere reminiscent of a country fair. Prices for the varied products are in the affordable range and will not make you cautious unlike that at a fine dining outlet. Then, go to the sea side area where there are seats or wide ledges with a view of the marine vessels passing through False Creek. Just across the other side are high-rise structures serving as backdrop. A short distance from where you are will be the docking area for the ferryboats to transport passengers to the other side. Be ready during peak times for the multitude, all age range represented, enjoying the site. It's not necessarily distracting nor excessively chaotic. More like a carnival atmosphere or a weekend park scene. Hanker down among the seating spaces, savor the scene and let time pass by. Touristy, yes. Enjoyable, yeah!","May 3, 2019",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 11:42:39.810584,2021-06-18 11:42:39.902173,Prices for the varied products are in the affordable range and will not make you cautious unlike that at a fine dining outlet.,are in the affordable range and will not make you cautious unlike that at a fine dining outlet,0.99957674741745,housing,affordable

There is also a large inside traditional market with stalls selling everything from fruit and veg to arts and crafts and with many cafes and stalls to buy food.

7399,Granville Island: The Jewel of Vancouver,,"Granville Island was a concerted effort to reclaim an ageing industrial zone in the centre of Vancouver, at the mouth of False Creek. It's redevelopment in the 1970s focused on creating an industrially inspired mixed use setting, and challenged the notions of the day (and which continue in today's suburbs) that urban uses should be strictly separated. Industrial should be separated from residential, separated from commercial and so on. Granville Island blurs all these together and the result is a vibrant urban oasis, calming and pleasant but also bursting with cultural activities, excellent locally made handicraft markets, local light industry, an arts college, and quaint restaurants.

We were on our way to find food when I FINALLY remembered, because we ran into it, that the food market was the main draw. The market buildings did not disappoint. Since we were tourists we did not plan on buying fresh fruit or produce, and did not. We did enjoy seeing the variety of foods for sale, both fresh and commercially packaged. We enjoyed our chowder pot pies in a mug which were hard to eat sitting outside on the benches so we were happy when our perseverance allowed us to share a table inside with a family. In addition to that meal we snacked on bread, pastries, and sausages. The market was busy and aisles were narrow, so it was a perfect market! There was lots of variety in food and produce options, as well as, art. It is true the island is car busy and there are lots of visitors. Nevertheless, the view of south downtown Vancouver is worth the visit, as are the houseboats, and the park. Add the incredible market and it, as the guide books suggest, a must see!

But you have to know how to visit it. Yes, there is a great comprehensive farmers market that has everything you need but there is so much more.I really recommend taking a food tour of the market as they know the special foods that make this market stand out (like the amazing Lee's donuts that I grew up on, the soup markers and terra breads). Check out the different foodie tours on trip advisor.Next you need to know that Granville island is a mecca of local theatre. Vancouver's famed theatre sports league (think Second City) is based here as is the iconic Arts club theatre ( known for reasonably priced local theatre projects), carrousel theatre (known for its children's shows) and the groundbreaking Performance works experimental theatre at the far end of the island.Next, you need to explore the arts side of the island. The BC craft council as a great old house they converted into the destination for local artisans and their products. Want a great made in BC made gift? Go here or the massive made in BC store in the net loft building. Also visit the wikininish gallery for amazing First Nations Jewelery (the bracelets are famous), clothing and souvenirs. Also check out the local glass blowing studio, the famed broom makers shop and visit the Emily Carr University's student's art gallery ( it's free) for fascinating ever changing shows on their work. Last thing, check out the university's library and sit for a while to look at an amazing collection of art magazines and books.Finally, you need to check out the other two markets in the island...the kids only market made specifically for little ones (probably one of the best kids store/attractions I have ever seen of its kind)...check out the kites and climbing zoo in the middle of the building. Finally, check out the maritime market for the best rain gear to weather Vancouver's ever changing liquid sunshine.

10320,So good we visited twice!,,"So good we visited twice!To get to/from the ""island"" we used 3 different routes. The sea taxi was probably my favourite, which you can get from the downtown Vancouver side pretty frequently, it seemed. My least favourite way was walking across the bridge. Although you get to then walk into the area via the very cool sign (as seen in all the photos!) it does mean (if you're walking) crossing a bridge which wasn't great with my fear of heights! Most people would be fine though, I imagine. Both days we walked back to our hotel by using the coastal path that snakes through the Fairview residential area and passes the Olympic village, Science Museum and many other sights. You can sample some excellent food from the market and delicious ice cream from Eat Canada (recommended by our tour guide). Be sure to wander around the artists' studios too and get a photo of the colourful painted silos. On our second visit we took a detour before the sign seen in all the pictures and headed West along the Marina - there is a great little fish restaurant (Go Fish) where you have to queue for a little while but it's entirely worth it: best fish and chips we'd ever eaten (and as 2 Londoners, that's saying a lot!)","August 16, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 14:54:27.381542,2021-06-18 14:54:27.469919,"Both days we walked back to our hotel by using the coastal path that snakes through the Fairview residential area and passes the Olympic village, Science Museum and many other sights.","walked back to our hotel by using the coastal path that snakes through the Fairview residential area and passes the Olympic village, Science Museum and many other sights",0.9736195802688599,housing,residential

10984,An Absolute Must for a Vancouver Visit!,,"Granville Island is delightful. Enjoy an afternoon strolling the streets filled with excellent art galleries (most of which featured local artists), restaurants, boutiques, and waterfront amusements. I wanted to enter each and every establishment!After building our appetites by exploring the area, we had a lovely lunch at Bridges restaurant. It is a landmark on Granville. The view from the top floor is wonderful. The floor to ceiling windows afford fabulous views of Falls Creek, downtown Vancouver's Yaletown, and the snow capped Rockies in the distance.The menu was not extensive but imaginatively impressive. The Miso Green Beans appetizer was wonderful. As typical of anywhere in BC there was no shortage of beautiful BC wines and brews.Next door to Bridges is the Granville Public Market. It is Vancouver's version of Paris' Les Halles, Toronto's Kensington Market or London's Camden Market, except that it is mostly indoors.Stroll aisle after aisle of crafts and jewelry, souvenirs and trinkets, seafood, more seafood like brilliant oysters and fish, meats, charcouteries, and delis. Oyama Sausage Company has the most amazing selection of pates and cured meats as well as supposedly humanely raised fowl for fois gras. Hanging from the rafters are whole cured ham shanks, and dozens of sausages. I tasted several pate's before deciding upon a goose pate with cognac, a duck pate with calvados, and one other. If only I could take some home to Arizona.After shopping we walked to the opposite end of the island and had a nice drink at a hotel restaurant to cap of the afternoon's activities. The Dockside Restaurant at Granville Island Hotel has a lovely patio with comfortable seating and an unobstructed view of the marina.

Upon arrival and thankful for the 3 hour complimentary parking we entered the market and were BLOWN AWAY with the energy and frenzy we observed!! So we threw on our backpacks and joined in! We started on west side of the building and were met by Wonderful and Friendly vendors displaying everything from flavored popcorn to handcrafted ornaments. We spent almost 40 mins. in this one area, I had to drag my companion out so we could move on to other areas, LOL. We then entered the middle section of the market where beautiful handcrafted souvenirs were being sold, ranging from purses and coin purses, to personalized jewelry. All neatly crafted and simple, making a wonderful gift for Loved ones back home. Yes and once again I had to drag my companion out because our 3 hour parking limit was draining. Throughout this adventure in the market we entered the food and pastry sections. The only way to describe it is, OMG!! Freshly made tart desserts topped with large pieces of berries!! It was overwhelming as to what to buy! As we looked around to different dessert vendors they all seemed to have one thing in common, Large and Plump Berries! After nearly 2 hours inside the market we finally were able to walk around and visit several shops looking for unique gifts. We took a stroll down the boardwalk and stumbled upon a resident of a house boat walking her dog. We spoke with her for a few minutes and continued down the boardwalk taking pictures. Realizing we were approaching our 3 hour parking limit we hurried back to our car, disappointed because there was more to do and see, yet Extremely Happy we were able to visit Granville Island.

I go there if I want some fresh fish, quality meat, artisanal cheese, organic fruit and veggies which are all available at the Granville Island Market. It's a place that is always abuzz!. Some vendors entice browsers by offering samples of new varietals or freshly baked morsels. No matter what your motifs for visiting the market, you will definitely enjoy its ambiance. Some 30 years ago Granville Island used to be an industrial area full of small workshops. Today, it is largely where tourists and locals alike go to spend a leisurely afternoon or evening. From the downtown side, you can reach GI from several ferry stops. All you do is hop on one of the tiny aqua-buses which ply back and forth across False Creek. (There are stops near Science World, Yale-town, and the Planetarium.) One of my favourite things to do is to grab a gelato and stroll along the waterfront where you can usually find some live entertainment in addition to keeping an eye on your favourite yacht, kayak or even dragon boat as it passes by. There are numerous interesting studios to visit. I love going to the Granville Island Broom Company where you can watch them make corn brooms the old fashioned way. Railspur Alley is a hub of woodworkers, potters, and even a sake-maker. And the open-air Ocean Art Works is a Johnston Street favourite to see First Nations artists carving totems or boat-builders shaping a craft.There are fine dining options too: Edible Canada, Bridges and the Sandbar! You can rent a bike and cycle from Granville Island all around False Creek and even to Stanley Park.

Then the Aquabus to cross the Fake creek for 25 minutes there's discounts for seniors and kids below 12 years old.

It was a very long day because we took a walk through different neighborhoods of the city on our way to Granville Island. Some of these neighborhoods, most with very tall glass apartment buildings, look much more modern. These areas are in significant contrast to the more historic downtown and the sheer size of the towers made it immediately clear to us how Vancouver fits in 2 million people. Anyway, when my heel began to form a callous, we went to the water taxi (which we loved) stop from where we were whisked straight to the Island of Food.Water Taxi in Vancouver is so cute. It looks like toy-size boat. From Granville Island you can enjoy more views of beautiful tall glass buildings, yachts, and bridges.Views aside, it is all about Granville Food Market, a foodie's erotic dream! The space is somewhat tight, but there are so many different corners of amazing food. The hundreds of delicacies are almost overwhelming. My husband actually got a little dizzy from what can only be described as a sensual assault of sight, sound, color and aroma. You can find everything you want from meats to sweets, from veggies to cheeses, from baked goodies to pastas. There are also several restaurants around the market with very interesting menus. I don't know how we survived in that food heaven by not eating everything.

15476,Great way to spend a day!,,"Went over to Granville Island during our recent trip to Vancouver. We were staying on Hornby not too far across False Creek. Instead of taking the Aqua bus, we figured we would just walk across the Granville Bridge since we don't get to walk much at home. Well. Let me tell you it is a pretty long walk! I figured that there would be stairs so that you didn't have to maneuver the on-and off- ramps. No such luck. The off ramp into the area takes you past the market and then yo have to backtrack. Can't complain though since it's a nice little neighborhood and we passed by a couple of cute shops - including a yummy chocolate shop - chocolate arts. When you first enter the ""island"" you see the kids market on your right. Avoid this at all costs. While it's cute and full of fun little stores, your child will never want to leave and will want everything inside of it. We quickly found a way out and continued on. Lots of great little shops and the market is great with food stands and vendors. Saw a few street performers and even saw a couple guys working on totem poles - very cool. The weather was beautiful so we took advantage of the great water park for our daughter. Lots of sprays and shooting water to run through plus the best part, a FREE water slide. There is a community center next to the water park where you can change, use the restrooms, etc. If you like sake, there is a little sake tasting joint not too far from the park. I don't like sake, but my husband checked it out while my daughter and I were at the water park. Needless to say he came back a happy man. We ended our time on the island with a beer sampling at Granville Island Brewing (see separate review). Overall a great way to spend the day.","August 31, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 16:48:33.841010,2021-06-18 16:48:33.918236,Can't complain though since it's a nice little neighborhood,complain though since it's a nice little neighborhood,0.9874966144561768,housing,neighborhood

While there's a huge array of food there, some of the prices are way more expensive than downtown Vancouver, particularly the meat. It's a great place to wonder around though, checking out all the arts and crafts shops and there's far more to see than Pike Place in Seattle. We sat looking out over the harbour while we ate a fantastic salmon burger for lunch, and while it was pretty crowded, it was still an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.

16648,Beloved by residents and visitors alike,,"Pretty much any Vancouver resident will recommend a visit to Granville Island to tourists, and they won't be disappointed. There is a lot to see and do there; plan on spending at least a half-day exploring. The bustling Public Market is the heart of Granville Island; if your accommodations in town have a kitchen, take advantage and buy yourself the ingredients for a gourmet meal. You can also get an excellent lunch at the Market's ""food court"", with its many unique (i.e. non-fast-food-chain) outlets. But Granville Island is not limited to the Market. The refurbished industrial buildings around it are home to numerous craftspeople and shops selling their wares. Take the time to explore the various nooks and crannies--there's something here for everyone. (My favourite: the New-Small & Sterling Glass Studio, where you can often stroll by and see glass-makers at work with their fiery furnaces!) There are also restaurants, street performers, a market just for kids, theatres, a brewery, a hotel, a community centre, an art & design college, and even a working cement factory. (Other reviews which have said there isn't much to do here stupefy me.)A parking tip: On a sunny day, especially on a weekend, traffic on the Island can be hectic and parking sparse. There's parking available in the mixed commercial/light industrial/residential neighbourhood to the west, so if you drive to the Island consider parking there and walking; there's a seawall beside the west-side marina, which is a very pleasant stroll.

So many Asian kids attending paid schooling in many suspect colleges. Many foreign adventurers passing through. Hard to find the nitty gritty of those that built this city. Seems it has been turned over to outsiders lock stock and barrel. It is therefore cold as attempting to break into new circles is complicated by the ethnic mix and for others the simple fact you are an unknown. Restaurants? Fantastic. World class. Hole in the walls. Fantastic. World Class. Nothing you cannot find. Food trucks add to the variety. Simply outstanding. Better Chinese food locally than anywhere in North America. Some from Hong Kong say even better than Hong Kong. Maybe a stretch but great regardless. Traffic is a joke. Bike lanes totally mess up downtown manuverability. Stores are unattractive.

The downtown core is very well organised with wide streets and considerate people. I was very lucky to get good weather on 5 of my 8 days there (in November) - thank you Global Warming.... I think.The area around downtown - including Gastown, Yaletown, Mt. Pleasant and Kitsilano are all very nice. Gastown is very hip and busy, Yaletown an upscale mix of residential and retail while Kits has a relaxed vibe. If you like to walk, bring your running shoes. You can get to all the above places on foot and enjoy tremendous views of the city. Stanley Park is not to be missed either. Cross Lion Gate bridge if you have no fear of heights.Very good food, the coffee is generally too bitter for my liking (but clearly the locals like it like that). Excellent shopping - I got lucky again in that more than half the shops had 30 to 40% discount while I was there. The city is very green - which I appreciate. Excellent public transport system, bike share and car share (Car2Go) programs as well as recycling bins everywhere. The air is about as clean as you can ask for in a large to medium size city. The tap water is delicious. Plenty of healthy vegetarian food options and tons of good Asian food.Amazing views from my hotel room - I highly recommend the Blue Horizon Hotel for good location, efficient staff and those views. Ask for a room on a higher floor.I've travelled a fair bit and my impression till now was that Rio de Janeiro is the most beautiful city.

Stanley Park is obviously impressive but it seems that all the open space was taken and put in one location rather than distributed across the city, leaving very little relief from the urban areas. I liked Yaletown best with great restaurants. Gastown was good as well, with trendy shops and restaurants but is darker and rougher.

To your left is the famous gastown, the old city of vancouver which was burned. It maintains its old classic atmosphere with brick roads and quaint shops and eateries. You won't go hungry. At 12 noon you will hear the old clock. Time to eat, that is. To your right as you leave the cruise ship, you can find a huge convention centre and the further up is the Olympic cauldron. Remember Vancouver was the site of the Winter Olympics that featured its sister-city up North, Whistler, famous for its ski resorts and now, triathlon. Go strength is a combination of office and residential buildings. What makes Vancouver vibrant is that it is alive after office hours because many office people live downtown. Therefore, many restaurants are open in the evening. Unlike other cities where office people live out of town and therefore the city is like a ghost town after office. In those cities, you will be hard pressed to find a MacDonalds open at night. One can do a hop on and off tour. Or simply walk the city core for exercise and taste the food at every block.

Baker volcano as backdrops, that a walk or a ride simply inspires. Not many cities can feel this good! Stanley Park, right downtown, is one of the greatest urban parks in the world with totem poles, never-ending views, ancient trees, and a world-class aquarium. The downtown area has many magnetic neighborhoods and restaurants, with glassy apartment buildings that will excite or bore you depending on your taste. Culture is not as exciting as New York, Chicago or even LA, but you can't have everything. Shoreline parks such as Jericho Beach, Kitsilano, Spanish Banks, will make you want to live here (but check your bank account). SunYat Sen garden will inspire. There used to be endless cheap ethnic restaurants in town but these, while still present, have succumbed to the urbanization and wealth.

Also worth visiting Chinatown - just watch out where you go, there is a very bad neighbourhood near by. The restaurants in Chinatown serve the best Chinese food outside China.

I researched a number of options before visiting Vancouver, and chose Taste Vancouver's Little Italy/The Drive walk because it seemed so authentic and friendly, and an opportunity to get to know an area I might not have discovered, staying downtown.

But the walk: It is a leisurely stroll that includes local history, personal insights into the businesses and the families that run them, and good food. A *lot* of good food! Over 2.5 hours, we visited 10 establishments and enjoyed authentic Neapolitan pizza, old school sausage sandwiches, cheese samples, cold cuts samples, a plate of spaghetti and meatball. We sampled wine from Piemonte, had fantastic hazelnut gelato, a perfect cappuccino, delicious cannoli, and more.

Yet this year seems to be particularly bad for road closures and construction.For anyone who knows the area, once you start heading to the heart of downtown, you need to take the sky train in. Right now there is a parking shortage as road closures due to construction and added bike lanes has highly limited access, and if you find a meter get ready to remortgage your house. I would suggest perhaps the bus, but these are also being effected by all the construction.Current roads closed (as bad as in some places 4 lanes now down to one lane, during rush hour) include Cambie, Granville, (Granville street bridge since summer), Richards, Seymour, Howe, Burrard (Burrard Street Bridge), Pender and Georgia. If you know Vancouver, it was already considered the worst city in North America for congestion (even rated worse then LA), so now that ALL major arteries going into city are at 50% or below capacity, well do the math.My opinion, come enjoy what the downtown has to offer another year when the City of Vancouver decides to start regulating road closures during peak hours.","December 5, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:39:56.842206,2021-06-18 18:39:56.924984,"Right now there is a parking shortage as road closures due to construction and added bike lanes has highly limited access, and if you find a meter get ready to remortgage your house.","is a parking shortage as road closures due to construction and added bike lanes has highly limited access, and if you find a meter get ready to remortgage your house",-0.9901303648948669,housing,house

4276,A very strange mix,,"I really wanted to rate the downtown Vancouver area higher, but felt strongly about what my wife and I experienced on our recent trip. Vancouver was a very pretty city with a strange mix of cultures and infrastructure. For instance, 2 blocks from our hotel was a very posh, ritzy, area with plenty of monetary influences. We stood at a cross-walk and watched no less than 5 Mercedes and two Ferrari's drive by. But then we would venture another two blocks and be greeted by terrible smelling streets (imagine if portable toilets had overflown) and trash literally strewn about in every direction. We were even warned by our hotel about certain parts of town to stay away from.When it came to strolling around town for some light shopping or dining, we were again greeted with a strange mix of choices. It was either the ultra luxury retail stores, or some very old very worn souvenir shops. No real middle ground existed. The same was true of the dining experiences. It was either very high end dining, or tiny cafe's (we did see a Carl's Junior). And we were very disappointed in the Olympic Village area of Vancouver as well. It was still listed as a ""destination"" on our map, and in our guide book, and when we got there the only thing we found was a housing development. Granted the condo's looked nice, but nothing indicated that this was where the athlete's had lived. If you didn't know the Olympics had been in Vancouver, you would have NEVER guessed based on actually being there now. And the plaza of nations has been turned into a casino. Again, we were very disappointed in what the city has done with its olympic buildings.We came to the conclusion that Vancouver might be best experienced as a 1 night or 1 day layover to somewhere else in Canada. A lot of cruises take off from Vancouver, as do tours destined for Whistler and other parts of the Canadian frontier.

4482,Vancouver highlights,,"Long weekend in Vancouver (BC)As the Labour Day holiday was approaching this year, Vera and I were making plans how to spend this long weekend in neighboring province of British Columbia. Our plan was to drive there and visit our friends in Langley (BC) and we also wanted to finally tour the city of Vancouver. I knew, it was going to be a long drive, but I like driving so off we went on Friday morning (I had an extra day off from work) via Jasper and Kamloops on this 1000 km journey through western Canada.Vancouver was our destination for this journeyHighway journeyWe took Yellowhead highway 16 to Jasper and continued (without stopping) on highway 5 through Valemount and Clearwater, all the way down to Kamloops. We then continued down Highway 5 (the Coquihalla Highway) down through Merritt and Hope to Chilliwack. Some say this road is a toll road, but we didn't have to pay for this road (Sep 2012). It is a good, double lane road, though. From Chilliwack I drove on the highway 1 straight towards Vancouver and took exit for Langley.We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house. We discussed our plans for the next day and went to bed early, so that we'll be well rested for the long touristy day in Vancouver.Sea-to-Sky HighwayLangley is a short 45 minutes drive from Vancouver and we made to the city by avoiding the busy highway 5 where there are always traffic issues. Instead we used the ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"", which is actually highway 99. This highway travels along the scenic Pacific Ocean vistas, bustling communities and parks. Smooth moving traffic at the times we've been on it. The ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"" is the name given to the section of Highway 99 starting just north of Horseshoe Bay. From Horseshoe Bay, the highway travels along the coast of Howe Sound for 12 km to Lions Bay, north for another 21 km to Britannia Beach, and further north for 11 more km to Squamish, at the head of Howe Sound. We left the highway once we reached the city as we were heading towards the North Vancouver. We wanted to visit well known tourist attraction 'Capilano Suspension bridge'.Arial view of VancouverVancouver CityWe've been in Vancouver previously, but never had time to be a real tourists and see the city from that perspective. Here is my short story and how it went this time...Our 2-day itinerary of Vancouver began in Vancouver's North Shore where we visited Capilano Suspension bridge. From there we went into Stanley park and stopped at the downtown peninsula in the heart of the city to walk the Vancouver's Port Metro and Gastown area. All those spots provided a small glimpse of what makes Vancouver Canada's most beautiful city.Vancouver Yacht clubVancouver is, after all, one of the cities that routinely tops those lists of the world's greatest places to live. But beyond the breathtaking snowcapped crags, city-hugging beaches and dense waterfront forests lies a comparatively young metropolis that's still trying to discover its true identity - less than 150 years after a 'gassy' Englishman rowed in and kicked it all off with a makeshift pub.Arial view of Vancouver harborCapilano Suspension bridgeYeah, it's a tourist trap but I like to be a super tourist and do touristy things when I travel. At $34 a pop to enter it is not cheap. Food is expensive in the park but you get a free poncho if it might rain... lol! It didn't when we were there... instead we had a great weather! It's a great look at nature for someone from the big city like us.Capilano Suspension bridgeThe park itself is quite scenic and has some interesting activities: network of short suspension bridges between trees, a semicircular bridge jutting out from a cliff, some cool informative displays, and of course the Capilano bridge. But on a weekend it was full of tourists, who thought nothing of holding up everyone behind them to get several shots of their kids with no one else in the frame. That made it for very slow bridge crossing. If you're sensitive to heights and bridge swinging, you shouldn't go.Swinging Capilano Suspension bridgeSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffThere are no true hiking trails, and the park is not very big, you will cover all the ground in about 90 minutes. I would say it would be worth it for ~$15, but the fee is extortionate and a true nature lover would be better served elsewhere. I can see how it is great for families or people looking for a manageable nature walk. If you do go, take your time and explore everything, the views throughout are lovely.Network of short suspension bridges between treesCurrent admission to the bridge is $34 for adults, $27 for teens, and $12 for kids 6-12. We could go free to Lynn Canyon. What do I think beauty is worth? Can I afford this much money for this one attraction though? You could argue there are more bridges and things to see at Capilano, but the thrill of crossing a suspension bridge was the experience we were looking for. Going to the free, public Lynn Canyon bridge would fit the bill just fine... perfectly even. So, next time I'll go there...Capilano Bridge HistoryIt was about 1890 that George Mackay discovered the spot, where Capliano Suspension Bridge now stands. Impressed by the beauty of the land, he built a cabin for himself and his wife. Then, with the help of local natives and a team of horses, he pulled taut the first cedar plank and hemp rope bridge 450 feet across and 230 feet above Capilano River.Mackay's friends began their journey to the bridge by crossing Burrard Inlet abroad the S.S. Senator. A long trek up the rough trail that is new Capilano Road led to their being dubbed, Capilano Tramps. The encumbrances of their dress did little to deter the spirited adventurers, who steadily visited the bridge. It was such a popular attraction that a second, and more secure, wire bridge was built in 1903. Another wire bridge, with both cable ends firmly encased in concrete, was built in 1914.In 1911, the Tea House (now the Trading Post) was built on the edge of Capilano Canyon. Later, during 1930s, bridge owner, Mac MacEachran, initiated the tradition of inviting local natives to place their totem poles on the grounds. The totems, you see here today, are maintained in the exact condition, in which they were received about 1940. This is unlike many of the poles, you may see elsewhere, which have been allowed to deteriorate with the passage of time.At the end of cliff walksBeautiful scenic canyon deep down under the bridgeDuring this 1930's Depression, two Danish carvers, Aage Madsen and Karl Hansen, arrived at the Bridge to sell their craft. In return for provisions and shelter in a small shack, on the far side of the Canyon, they carved the life sized native Indian statues that are scattered throughout the Park. The European perception of natives is apparent in the Plains Indian attire of the figures.The only exception is the carving of Mary Capilano, who is dressed in typical West Coast fashion with papoose Mathias Joe Capilano on her back. Mary was the only local native the two carvers had actually met.In 1956, the present bridge was built. This time the pre-stressed wire cables were encased in 13 tons of concrete at either end.Several attractions have been added to the Park in 1990s, including The Story Center and Living Forest Exhibits, the cantilevered deck along the Canyon edge, the big house native carving center, the Pioneer Garden and the Loggers' Grill...Stanley ParkLook at an aerial map of Vancouver and you'll see the huge patch of green dominating the downtown peninsula. This green patch is Stanley Park Vancouver, the gem of the city that makes Vancouver what it is. The park is nearly 1000 acres in size, reflecting the city's love for nature and appreciation for preserving green spaces, even in such a quickly-growing area.unner statue of Harry Jerome (Canadian Olympian three times: 1960, 1964 and 1968) in Stanley ParkStanley Park is the largest urban park in North America, and opposed to other famous North American parks such as Central Park in New York, Stanley Park Vancouver is not just a manicured sprawl of lawns and neatly planted trees. What makes Stanley Park unique are the amazing views on the wrap-around Stanley Park seawall, the dense rainforests, the marshland, and the beaches.Stanley Park mapThe Stanley Park seawall follows the park along the Oceanside with bike and pedestrian pathways. Every day joggers, bikers, rollerbladers, walkers and others out to enjoy the view can follow the Stanley Park seawall for 10.5 km along the beach. Away from the seawall and the perimeter of the park, a dense forest grows, where few people actually spend much time. Like other parks, there are also plenty of lawn areas to play soccer or toss a Frisbee, and a number of beaches for sunbathing and volleyball. On this beautiful and sunny September's Sunday, when the temperature was reaching almost 30 degrees, park was really crowded and people were everywhere. We drove around the park as it was difficult to find parking. It was still enjoyable...Lions Gate Bridge viewed from Stanley ParkFamilies enjoying the bike ride in the parkStanley Park history begins in the early stages of the city's development. In 1886 the city council made the insightful decision to turn what had become a military reserve into a park. The towering cedars, swamp lands (now known as Lost Lagoon), and prime water-front property were all set aside for the ""use and enjoyment of people of all colors, creeds and customs for all time,"" according to Lord Stanley, Canada's governor general from1888 to 1893. Stanley Park history set the tone for the way the city would evolve; deeply committed to the preservation of its natural resources.To best enjoy Stanley Park, try renting a bicycle at one of the many bike rental stores along the way. To walk the entire Stanley Park seawall it takes about two hours at a brisk pace, so don't expect to be able to breeze through the park in a few minutes. Besides, there is so much to do and see in the park, you'll want to take your time.There are a number of restaurants in Stanley Park where you can enjoy a delicious meal with a stunning view. Try afternoon tea at the Rose Garden or lunch at the scenic Sequoia Grill (formerly the Stanley Park Teahouse). The Fish House has delicious seafood in a beautiful heritage house. At the Prospect Point viewpoint there is a nice cafe. While touring around the park, make a stop at the totem poles, and plan some time to see the Vancouver Aquarium.View on downtown Vancouver from Stanley ParkIf you decide to tackle Stanley Park Vancouver on foot, the Translink bus system can make the distance between attractions much quicker. Look for the ''Stanley Park Shuttle'' which runs on a fifteen-minute schedule daily from June through August. The bus makes fourteen stops around the park.Cruise ship docked in Vancouver PortCruising Port Metro VancouverAfter visiting Stanley Park, we found parking at the Vancouver Convention Centre. From there everything we planed to see was on a walking distance. For more than 30 years, the Port Metro Vancouver has been a leading homeport for Alaska cruises. The Port's two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, are conveniently located and only 30 minutes away from the Vancouver International Airport. Canada Place is located in the city centre, close to shopping, dining, attractions, and Stanley Park. Ballantyne is located east of the city centre and close to Canada Place. The cruise terminals are modern, secure, and world-class.Port Metro VancouverThe Port welcomed 199 ship visits and more than 663,000 revenue passengers at its two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, which offer all the modern conveniences and services for a positive and safe cruise experience.The Capitan... my Captain!!Canada PlacePort Metro Vancouver's premier cruise facility is located in the city centre, at 999 Canada Place near excellent hotels, shopping, dining, entertainment and attractions. Its distinctive white sail design, five-star hotel, and the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre make Canada Place an attractive start and finish to any cruise experience. When we walked through the Convention Centre, Aritzia clothing company, was having a 'only once a year' warehouse sale and swarms of shoppers hit this warehouse sale and were walking around with the Aritzia begs...Canada Place in VancouverBallantyneBallantyne, Port Metro Vancouver's second cruise facility, is located at 851 Centennial Road, east of the city centre and just minutes away from Canada Place. The entire terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation in 1995, ensuring modern and efficient services to the cruise industry.Travellers to Ballantyne have access to Ballantyne Cruise Terminal via Clark Drive or McGill Street Overpass only. There is no access to travelers via Victoria Drive and Heatley Avenue.Historic GastownGateway to historic GastownAfter visiting port of Vancouver, we walked several blocks to Gastown. Gastown is where Vancouver originated from. The original part of Vancouver - Gastown - came about in 1867 after a man named ""Gassy Jack"". Deighton opened up a saloon near a lumber mill in the area.Today Gastown itself is a cobble stoned regenerated area with shops as disparate as vintage outlets to the more tourist orientated stores. It's also home to the world's first steam powered clock, which can still be seen working to this day. It also has some great bars for a night out such as the Lamplighter, the Cork and Fin and the Salt Tasting Room.The most touristy spot is by this steam-powered clockBusy Gastown street with globe-shaped street lampsThe old-world charm of Gastown sits in the middle of the modern city of Vancouver. Gastown is recognized by its cobblestone roads and globe-shaped street lamps. This place has an interesting mix of historical sites, modern upscale housing, souvenir shops, art galleries, restaurants, boutiques and professional offices. Today Gastown has been designated as a heritage site.Busy streets in Gastown areaThere is a landmark in Gastown that is hard to miss. It is a steam-powered clock that sits on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. In 1977, Ray Saunders, a Canadian horologist, was commissioned by the city of Vancouver to build the steam clock to cover a steam grate. It was an honour to be able to have Ray showing me how the clock works. Today, the steam clock attracts thousands of visitors waiting to hear the whistle blow every quarter of an hour. It is also one of the most photographed landmarks in the city.Gastown HistoryEstablished the same year that Canada became a nation, Gastown grew into Canada's third largest city and one of its most cosmopolitan. But the Gastown district today retains its historic charm, independent spirit and distinctiveness. There's no mistaking Gastown for any other area of Vancouver, or of Canada for that matter.1867: The south shore of Burrard Inlet was a wilderness. Its only non-native settlement was a lumber mill where the owner didn't allow alcohol on the premises.One September day, ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton arrived (he received his nickname because of his penchant for spinning tall tales and talking without end). He stepped ashore with a barrel of whiskey, telling the millworkers that if they'd build him a saloon, he'd serve them drinks. The saloon was up and running within a day...just across the property line of the mill. Gastown was born.1870: On March 1st, in order to give it a more distinguished name, Gastown was officially proclaimed to be ""Granville"", after the British colonial secretary. But everybody in the rough and tumble settlement continued to call it Gastown.1886: Gastown was incorporated as the City of Vancouver, after British explorer, George Vancouver. That was April 6th. On June 13th, a brush-clearing fire got out of control and turned all but two of Vancouver's 400 buildings to ashes.1920s: Gastown grew and prospered, as did the rest of the City of Vancouver. But good times couldn't last forever.Depression Years: Gastown fell on hard times and deteriorated into a stereotypical skid road area until the 1960s.1960s: With talk of demolishing the area becoming more widespread, a group of dedicated citizens took it upon themselves to save Gastown's distinctive architecture and character. The city rallied around them. Gastown was not just saved, it was reborn.1971: The provincial government declared Gastown an historic area, protecting its heritage buildings.This steam-powered clock sits on the corner of Cambie and Water StreetToday: Gastown is a refreshing mix of old and new, downhome and upscale, a place for tourists, Vancouver residents and office workers alike. Various shops have the streets buzzing during the day. A host of restaurants and nightspots keeps the area humming into the wee hours. And, more and more, Gastown is becoming home to permanent residents... just like in the old days.Gastown WebsiteWater St. CafeWater St. CafeGastown seems to be a perfect place to rest our tired touristy feet and find a place to sit and have a lunch. We picked the restaurant which is just across from the 'Steam Clock', at the intersection of Water Street and Cambie Street. We had no reservations but were lucky to get a table inside, with direct view of the famous Steam Clock. The Steam Clock is a big tourist attraction and it was interesting to watch other tourists stop at the Steam Clock to listen to the tunes the Clock plays on the quarter hour.We had good times at the Water St. CafeThe food at The Water Street Cafe was excellent. Our friends had the New York steak sandwich, my wife had the Forno Roasted chicken salad and I had Linguine Pesto with chicken pasta. Both were prepared to perfection. Service was a little slow but they were really busy. Highly recommended restaurant on a perfect spot.After lunch we walked down the Water Street. We're in tourist territory here - right next to the steam clock - so you're not going to find any bargain prices. But what you do want is some friendly service from people who seem like they care, and some decent food. This is what you get! There is also a good atmosphere which you won't always get in these sorts of locations. Noticed several homeless people laying on the sidewalks... not a great picture especially for this touristy area!Best place to liveIt is impossible to see more that what we did in only two days. We used our time to the max and really like it. There are endless things to do in Vancouver. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery and nature or explore all that the city has to offer you. If you ever feel like you need a change of pace, you can always find something new to do.Vancouver scenic viewsWith its scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is known around the world as one of the best places to live and is a popular tourist attraction. Vancouver is also one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada with 52% of the population speaking a first language other than English.Vancouver has been host to many international conferences and events, including the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.I would like to thank our hosts for their hospitality. In return I hope they enjoyed this two days tour of Vancouver with us as much as we did! I'm sure we'll be back to explore some more of this beautiful city!!","October 25, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:52:11.096674,2021-06-18 18:52:11.181476,We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house.,our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house,0.9983165264129639,housing,house
4482,Vancouver highlights,,"Long weekend in Vancouver (BC)As the Labour Day holiday was approaching this year, Vera and I were making plans how to spend this long weekend in neighboring province of British Columbia. Our plan was to drive there and visit our friends in Langley (BC) and we also wanted to finally tour the city of Vancouver. I knew, it was going to be a long drive, but I like driving so off we went on Friday morning (I had an extra day off from work) via Jasper and Kamloops on this 1000 km journey through western Canada.Vancouver was our destination for this journeyHighway journeyWe took Yellowhead highway 16 to Jasper and continued (without stopping) on highway 5 through Valemount and Clearwater, all the way down to Kamloops. We then continued down Highway 5 (the Coquihalla Highway) down through Merritt and Hope to Chilliwack. Some say this road is a toll road, but we didn't have to pay for this road (Sep 2012). It is a good, double lane road, though. From Chilliwack I drove on the highway 1 straight towards Vancouver and took exit for Langley.We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house. We discussed our plans for the next day and went to bed early, so that we'll be well rested for the long touristy day in Vancouver.Sea-to-Sky HighwayLangley is a short 45 minutes drive from Vancouver and we made to the city by avoiding the busy highway 5 where there are always traffic issues. Instead we used the ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"", which is actually highway 99. This highway travels along the scenic Pacific Ocean vistas, bustling communities and parks. Smooth moving traffic at the times we've been on it. The ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"" is the name given to the section of Highway 99 starting just north of Horseshoe Bay. From Horseshoe Bay, the highway travels along the coast of Howe Sound for 12 km to Lions Bay, north for another 21 km to Britannia Beach, and further north for 11 more km to Squamish, at the head of Howe Sound. We left the highway once we reached the city as we were heading towards the North Vancouver. We wanted to visit well known tourist attraction 'Capilano Suspension bridge'.Arial view of VancouverVancouver CityWe've been in Vancouver previously, but never had time to be a real tourists and see the city from that perspective. Here is my short story and how it went this time...Our 2-day itinerary of Vancouver began in Vancouver's North Shore where we visited Capilano Suspension bridge. From there we went into Stanley park and stopped at the downtown peninsula in the heart of the city to walk the Vancouver's Port Metro and Gastown area. All those spots provided a small glimpse of what makes Vancouver Canada's most beautiful city.Vancouver Yacht clubVancouver is, after all, one of the cities that routinely tops those lists of the world's greatest places to live. But beyond the breathtaking snowcapped crags, city-hugging beaches and dense waterfront forests lies a comparatively young metropolis that's still trying to discover its true identity - less than 150 years after a 'gassy' Englishman rowed in and kicked it all off with a makeshift pub.Arial view of Vancouver harborCapilano Suspension bridgeYeah, it's a tourist trap but I like to be a super tourist and do touristy things when I travel. At $34 a pop to enter it is not cheap. Food is expensive in the park but you get a free poncho if it might rain... lol! It didn't when we were there... instead we had a great weather! It's a great look at nature for someone from the big city like us.Capilano Suspension bridgeThe park itself is quite scenic and has some interesting activities: network of short suspension bridges between trees, a semicircular bridge jutting out from a cliff, some cool informative displays, and of course the Capilano bridge. But on a weekend it was full of tourists, who thought nothing of holding up everyone behind them to get several shots of their kids with no one else in the frame. That made it for very slow bridge crossing. If you're sensitive to heights and bridge swinging, you shouldn't go.Swinging Capilano Suspension bridgeSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffThere are no true hiking trails, and the park is not very big, you will cover all the ground in about 90 minutes. I would say it would be worth it for ~$15, but the fee is extortionate and a true nature lover would be better served elsewhere. I can see how it is great for families or people looking for a manageable nature walk. If you do go, take your time and explore everything, the views throughout are lovely.Network of short suspension bridges between treesCurrent admission to the bridge is $34 for adults, $27 for teens, and $12 for kids 6-12. We could go free to Lynn Canyon. What do I think beauty is worth? Can I afford this much money for this one attraction though? You could argue there are more bridges and things to see at Capilano, but the thrill of crossing a suspension bridge was the experience we were looking for. Going to the free, public Lynn Canyon bridge would fit the bill just fine... perfectly even. So, next time I'll go there...Capilano Bridge HistoryIt was about 1890 that George Mackay discovered the spot, where Capliano Suspension Bridge now stands.

Our plan was to drive there and visit our friends in Langley (BC) and we also wanted to finally tour the city of Vancouver. I knew, it was going to be a long drive, but I like driving so off we went on Friday morning (I had an extra day off from work) via Jasper and Kamloops on this 1000 km journey through western Canada.Vancouver was our destination for this journeyHighway journeyWe took Yellowhead highway 16 to Jasper and continued (without stopping) on highway 5 through Valemount and Clearwater, all the way down to Kamloops. We then continued down Highway 5 (the Coquihalla Highway) down through Merritt and Hope to Chilliwack. Some say this road is a toll road, but we didn't have to pay for this road (Sep 2012). It is a good, double lane road, though. From Chilliwack I drove on the highway 1 straight towards Vancouver and took exit for Langley.We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house. We discussed our plans for the next day and went to bed early, so that we'll be well rested for the long touristy day in Vancouver.Sea-to-Sky HighwayLangley is a short 45 minutes drive from Vancouver and we made to the city by avoiding the busy highway 5 where there are always traffic issues. Instead we used the ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"", which is actually highway 99. This highway travels along the scenic Pacific Ocean vistas, bustling communities and parks. Smooth moving traffic at the times we've been on it. The ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"" is the name given to the section of Highway 99 starting just north of Horseshoe Bay. From Horseshoe Bay, the highway travels along the coast of Howe Sound for 12 km to Lions Bay, north for another 21 km to Britannia Beach, and further north for 11 more km to Squamish, at the head of Howe Sound. We left the highway once we reached the city as we were heading towards the North Vancouver. We wanted to visit well known tourist attraction 'Capilano Suspension bridge'.Arial view of VancouverVancouver CityWe've been in Vancouver previously, but never had time to be a real tourists and see the city from that perspective. Here is my short story and how it went this time...Our 2-day itinerary of Vancouver began in Vancouver's North Shore where we visited Capilano Suspension bridge. From there we went into Stanley park and stopped at the downtown peninsula in the heart of the city to walk the Vancouver's Port Metro and Gastown area. All those spots provided a small glimpse of what makes Vancouver Canada's most beautiful city.Vancouver Yacht clubVancouver is, after all, one of the cities that routinely tops those lists of the world's greatest places to live. But beyond the breathtaking snowcapped crags, city-hugging beaches and dense waterfront forests lies a comparatively young metropolis that's still trying to discover its true identity - less than 150 years after a 'gassy' Englishman rowed in and kicked it all off with a makeshift pub.Arial view of Vancouver harborCapilano Suspension bridgeYeah, it's a tourist trap but I like to be a super tourist and do touristy things when I travel. At $34 a pop to enter it is not cheap. Food is expensive in the park but you get a free poncho if it might rain... lol! It didn't when we were there... instead we had a great weather! It's a great look at nature for someone from the big city like us.Capilano Suspension bridgeThe park itself is quite scenic and has some interesting activities: network of short suspension bridges between trees, a semicircular bridge jutting out from a cliff, some cool informative displays, and of course the Capilano bridge. But on a weekend it was full of tourists, who thought nothing of holding up everyone behind them to get several shots of their kids with no one else in the frame. That made it for very slow bridge crossing. If you're sensitive to heights and bridge swinging, you shouldn't go.Swinging Capilano Suspension bridgeSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffThere are no true hiking trails, and the park is not very big, you will cover all the ground in about 90 minutes. I would say it would be worth it for ~$15, but the fee is extortionate and a true nature lover would be better served elsewhere. I can see how it is great for families or people looking for a manageable nature walk. If you do go, take your time and explore everything, the views throughout are lovely.Network of short suspension bridges between treesCurrent admission to the bridge is $34 for adults, $27 for teens, and $12 for kids 6-12. We could go free to Lynn Canyon. What do I think beauty is worth? Can I afford this much money for this one attraction though? You could argue there are more bridges and things to see at Capilano, but the thrill of crossing a suspension bridge was the experience we were looking for. Going to the free, public Lynn Canyon bridge would fit the bill just fine... perfectly even. So, next time I'll go there...Capilano Bridge HistoryIt was about 1890 that George Mackay discovered the spot, where Capliano Suspension Bridge now stands. Impressed by the beauty of the land, he built a cabin for himself and his wife. Then, with the help of local natives and a team of horses, he pulled taut the first cedar plank and hemp rope bridge 450 feet across and 230 feet above Capilano River.Mackay's friends began their journey to the bridge by crossing Burrard Inlet abroad the S.S. Senator. A long trek up the rough trail that is new Capilano Road led to their being dubbed, Capilano Tramps. The encumbrances of their dress did little to deter the spirited adventurers, who steadily visited the bridge. It was such a popular attraction that a second, and more secure, wire bridge was built in 1903. Another wire bridge, with both cable ends firmly encased in concrete, was built in 1914.In 1911, the Tea House (now the Trading Post) was built on the edge of Capilano Canyon. Later, during 1930s, bridge owner, Mac MacEachran, initiated the tradition of inviting local natives to place their totem poles on the grounds. The totems, you see here today, are maintained in the exact condition, in which they were received about 1940. This is unlike many of the poles, you may see elsewhere, which have been allowed to deteriorate with the passage of time.At the end of cliff walksBeautiful scenic canyon deep down under the bridgeDuring this 1930's Depression, two Danish carvers, Aage Madsen and Karl Hansen, arrived at the Bridge to sell their craft. In return for provisions and shelter in a small shack, on the far side of the Canyon, they carved the life sized native Indian statues that are scattered throughout the Park. The European perception of natives is apparent in the Plains Indian attire of the figures.The only exception is the carving of Mary Capilano, who is dressed in typical West Coast fashion with papoose Mathias Joe Capilano on her back. Mary was the only local native the two carvers had actually met.In 1956, the present bridge was built. This time the pre-stressed wire cables were encased in 13 tons of concrete at either end.Several attractions have been added to the Park in 1990s, including The Story Center and Living Forest Exhibits, the cantilevered deck along the Canyon edge, the big house native carving center, the Pioneer Garden and the Loggers' Grill...Stanley ParkLook at an aerial map of Vancouver and you'll see the huge patch of green dominating the downtown peninsula. This green patch is Stanley Park Vancouver, the gem of the city that makes Vancouver what it is. The park is nearly 1000 acres in size, reflecting the city's love for nature and appreciation for preserving green spaces, even in such a quickly-growing area.unner statue of Harry Jerome (Canadian Olympian three times: 1960, 1964 and 1968) in Stanley ParkStanley Park is the largest urban park in North America, and opposed to other famous North American parks such as Central Park in New York, Stanley Park Vancouver is not just a manicured sprawl of lawns and neatly planted trees. What makes Stanley Park unique are the amazing views on the wrap-around Stanley Park seawall, the dense rainforests, the marshland, and the beaches.Stanley Park mapThe Stanley Park seawall follows the park along the Oceanside with bike and pedestrian pathways. Every day joggers, bikers, rollerbladers, walkers and others out to enjoy the view can follow the Stanley Park seawall for 10.5 km along the beach. Away from the seawall and the perimeter of the park, a dense forest grows, where few people actually spend much time. Like other parks, there are also plenty of lawn areas to play soccer or toss a Frisbee, and a number of beaches for sunbathing and volleyball. On this beautiful and sunny September's Sunday, when the temperature was reaching almost 30 degrees, park was really crowded and people were everywhere. We drove around the park as it was difficult to find parking. It was still enjoyable...Lions Gate Bridge viewed from Stanley ParkFamilies enjoying the bike ride in the parkStanley Park history begins in the early stages of the city's development. In 1886 the city council made the insightful decision to turn what had become a military reserve into a park. The towering cedars, swamp lands (now known as Lost Lagoon), and prime water-front property were all set aside for the ""use and enjoyment of people of all colors, creeds and customs for all time,"" according to Lord Stanley, Canada's governor general from1888 to 1893. Stanley Park history set the tone for the way the city would evolve; deeply committed to the preservation of its natural resources.To best enjoy Stanley Park, try renting a bicycle at one of the many bike rental stores along the way. To walk the entire Stanley Park seawall it takes about two hours at a brisk pace, so don't expect to be able to breeze through the park in a few minutes. Besides, there is so much to do and see in the park, you'll want to take your time.There are a number of restaurants in Stanley Park where you can enjoy a delicious meal with a stunning view. Try afternoon tea at the Rose Garden or lunch at the scenic Sequoia Grill (formerly the Stanley Park Teahouse). The Fish House has delicious seafood in a beautiful heritage house. At the Prospect Point viewpoint there is a nice cafe. While touring around the park, make a stop at the totem poles, and plan some time to see the Vancouver Aquarium.View on downtown Vancouver from Stanley ParkIf you decide to tackle Stanley Park Vancouver on foot, the Translink bus system can make the distance between attractions much quicker. Look for the ''Stanley Park Shuttle'' which runs on a fifteen-minute schedule daily from June through August. The bus makes fourteen stops around the park.Cruise ship docked in Vancouver PortCruising Port Metro VancouverAfter visiting Stanley Park, we found parking at the Vancouver Convention Centre. From there everything we planed to see was on a walking distance. For more than 30 years, the Port Metro Vancouver has been a leading homeport for Alaska cruises. The Port's two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, are conveniently located and only 30 minutes away from the Vancouver International Airport. Canada Place is located in the city centre, close to shopping, dining, attractions, and Stanley Park. Ballantyne is located east of the city centre and close to Canada Place. The cruise terminals are modern, secure, and world-class.Port Metro VancouverThe Port welcomed 199 ship visits and more than 663,000 revenue passengers at its two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, which offer all the modern conveniences and services for a positive and safe cruise experience.The Capitan... my Captain!!Canada PlacePort Metro Vancouver's premier cruise facility is located in the city centre, at 999 Canada Place near excellent hotels, shopping, dining, entertainment and attractions. Its distinctive white sail design, five-star hotel, and the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre make Canada Place an attractive start and finish to any cruise experience. When we walked through the Convention Centre, Aritzia clothing company, was having a 'only once a year' warehouse sale and swarms of shoppers hit this warehouse sale and were walking around with the Aritzia begs...Canada Place in VancouverBallantyneBallantyne, Port Metro Vancouver's second cruise facility, is located at 851 Centennial Road, east of the city centre and just minutes away from Canada Place. The entire terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation in 1995, ensuring modern and efficient services to the cruise industry.Travellers to Ballantyne have access to Ballantyne Cruise Terminal via Clark Drive or McGill Street Overpass only. There is no access to travelers via Victoria Drive and Heatley Avenue.Historic GastownGateway to historic GastownAfter visiting port of Vancouver, we walked several blocks to Gastown. Gastown is where Vancouver originated from. The original part of Vancouver - Gastown - came about in 1867 after a man named ""Gassy Jack"". Deighton opened up a saloon near a lumber mill in the area.Today Gastown itself is a cobble stoned regenerated area with shops as disparate as vintage outlets to the more tourist orientated stores. It's also home to the world's first steam powered clock, which can still be seen working to this day. It also has some great bars for a night out such as the Lamplighter, the Cork and Fin and the Salt Tasting Room.The most touristy spot is by this steam-powered clockBusy Gastown street with globe-shaped street lampsThe old-world charm of Gastown sits in the middle of the modern city of Vancouver. Gastown is recognized by its cobblestone roads and globe-shaped street lamps. This place has an interesting mix of historical sites, modern upscale housing, souvenir shops, art galleries, restaurants, boutiques and professional offices. Today Gastown has been designated as a heritage site.Busy streets in Gastown areaThere is a landmark in Gastown that is hard to miss. It is a steam-powered clock that sits on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. In 1977, Ray Saunders, a Canadian horologist, was commissioned by the city of Vancouver to build the steam clock to cover a steam grate. It was an honour to be able to have Ray showing me how the clock works. Today, the steam clock attracts thousands of visitors waiting to hear the whistle blow every quarter of an hour. It is also one of the most photographed landmarks in the city.Gastown HistoryEstablished the same year that Canada became a nation, Gastown grew into Canada's third largest city and one of its most cosmopolitan. But the Gastown district today retains its historic charm, independent spirit and distinctiveness. There's no mistaking Gastown for any other area of Vancouver, or of Canada for that matter.1867: The south shore of Burrard Inlet was a wilderness. Its only non-native settlement was a lumber mill where the owner didn't allow alcohol on the premises.One September day, ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton arrived (he received his nickname because of his penchant for spinning tall tales and talking without end). He stepped ashore with a barrel of whiskey, telling the millworkers that if they'd build him a saloon, he'd serve them drinks. The saloon was up and running within a day...just across the property line of the mill. Gastown was born.1870: On March 1st, in order to give it a more distinguished name, Gastown was officially proclaimed to be ""Granville"", after the British colonial secretary. But everybody in the rough and tumble settlement continued to call it Gastown.1886: Gastown was incorporated as the City of Vancouver, after British explorer, George Vancouver. That was April 6th. On June 13th, a brush-clearing fire got out of control and turned all but two of Vancouver's 400 buildings to ashes.1920s: Gastown grew and prospered, as did the rest of the City of Vancouver. But good times couldn't last forever.Depression Years: Gastown fell on hard times and deteriorated into a stereotypical skid road area until the 1960s.1960s: With talk of demolishing the area becoming more widespread, a group of dedicated citizens took it upon themselves to save Gastown's distinctive architecture and character. The city rallied around them. Gastown was not just saved, it was reborn.1971: The provincial government declared Gastown an historic area, protecting its heritage buildings.This steam-powered clock sits on the corner of Cambie and Water StreetToday: Gastown is a refreshing mix of old and new, downhome and upscale, a place for tourists, Vancouver residents and office workers alike. Various shops have the streets buzzing during the day. A host of restaurants and nightspots keeps the area humming into the wee hours. And, more and more, Gastown is becoming home to permanent residents... just like in the old days.Gastown WebsiteWater St. CafeWater St. CafeGastown seems to be a perfect place to rest our tired touristy feet and find a place to sit and have a lunch. We picked the restaurant which is just across from the 'Steam Clock', at the intersection of Water Street and Cambie Street. We had no reservations but were lucky to get a table inside, with direct view of the famous Steam Clock. The Steam Clock is a big tourist attraction and it was interesting to watch other tourists stop at the Steam Clock to listen to the tunes the Clock plays on the quarter hour.We had good times at the Water St. CafeThe food at The Water Street Cafe was excellent. Our friends had the New York steak sandwich, my wife had the Forno Roasted chicken salad and I had Linguine Pesto with chicken pasta. Both were prepared to perfection. Service was a little slow but they were really busy. Highly recommended restaurant on a perfect spot.After lunch we walked down the Water Street. We're in tourist territory here - right next to the steam clock - so you're not going to find any bargain prices. But what you do want is some friendly service from people who seem like they care, and some decent food. This is what you get! There is also a good atmosphere which you won't always get in these sorts of locations. Noticed several homeless people laying on the sidewalks... not a great picture especially for this touristy area!Best place to liveIt is impossible to see more that what we did in only two days. We used our time to the max and really like it. There are endless things to do in Vancouver. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery and nature or explore all that the city has to offer you. If you ever feel like you need a change of pace, you can always find something new to do.Vancouver scenic viewsWith its scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is known around the world as one of the best places to live and is a popular tourist attraction. Vancouver is also one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada with 52% of the population speaking a first language other than English.Vancouver has been host to many international conferences and events, including the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.I would like to thank our hosts for their hospitality. In return I hope they enjoyed this two days tour of Vancouver with us as much as we did!

Ok, I'll explain-- If you're fairly close to the buildings, most of them are beautiful from the sidewalk.

4687,I can understand why it is ranked as the best city to live in...,,"i visited Vancouver many times, but i never really hang around in the downtown area. In getting the SkyTrain ride experience, i sort of visited Vancouver downtown just for the sake of making a longer trip out of the SkyTrain visit. I find that Vancouver city is no different from any North American city, but it is indeed one of the best urban planned city in the world. the Robson street is a decent shopping street, but if you are hard core shoppers, you are better off visiting Toronto. I dare to say that it would take at best 3-4 hours to check out the whole Vancouver downtown. On the other hand, it is notable to indicate that i can understand why Vancouver is annually rated as one of the best city to live in because the downtown is not just a business town, but also a residential one. Many people actually live in the condos in the downtown area. I am much impressed by the urban planning however---there are not just bike lanes, but curbs and flower planters next to the bike lanes to separate the cars from the bikers. it is a very avantgarde urban approach to encouraging more cycling and less driving. I have to give Vancouver the credit for making their city cleverly green.","July 24, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:56:49.301756,2021-06-18 18:56:49.380512,"On the other hand, it is notable to indicate that i can understand why Vancouver is annually rated as one of the best city to live in because the downtown is not just a business town, but also a residential one.","is notable to indicate that i can understand why Vancouver is annually rated as one of the best city to live in because the downtown is not just a business town, but also a residential one",0.9992650151252747,housing,residential

28,The Original Vancouver,,"Gastown is Vancouver's most historic district and neighbourhood and was finally designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2009. Named after John ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton, this area of Vancouver is unique for its ability to maintain its historic charm while concomitantly looking forward towards the future. In other words, Gastown is able to provide a near-perfect synthesis of the old and new: Victorian and Edwardian-era architecture meets contemporary and chic boutiques, shops and restaurants. Because of this, any visit to Vancouver would ultimately be incomplete without some time spent in and around Gastown. It is home to some of the best the city has to offer, and it does all of this in a truly unique - attractive - environment.History is perhaps one of the primary reasons one might have for an initial visit to Gastown; and, believe me, this area has plenty of it. Established in and around 1867, when John Deighton sought to open a saloon (and did so within 24 hours!), Gastown very quickly became the fledgling city's trading, commerce, cultural and social hub. Because of its proximity to the waterfront, Gastown proved to be an ideal location for business to take root. With the influx of workers to the area, many a hotel, eatery and pub popped up, creating what I'm sure was an interesting cultural mosaic of sorts. In this respect, one could argue that the area essentially functioned as Vancouver's original downtown core.In fact, it was exactly because of all the hustle and bustle that Vancouver city council held their first official meeting in Gastown, specifically Maple Tree Square (see my earlier review on this site), following incorporation in 1886. Unfortunately, most of the original Gastown burned to the ground barely two months later in what has been dubbed the Great Fire of 1886. Not to be dissuaded, though, Gastown was very quickly rebuilt and, today, the majority of the buildings that stand in this neighbourhood date from 1886 to 1914, giving us a beautiful historic window into the past. For those particularly keen on architecture and style, Gastown is rife with buildings reflective of the Victorian and Edwardian period, right down to the 100+ year-old lampposts that line the streets. If one is on a limited schedule, however, I would recommend visiting the Waterfront Station (technically on Gastown's border on Cordova), seeing the Byrnes Block building (built 1886) and viewing the Hotel Europe (built 1909). Each of these architectural gems have their own tales and help to give Gastown its historical character.Beyond the historical aspect, Gastown has become a cultural and foodie hub since its initial revitalization in the late 1970s and 1980s. For at least the last two decades, many an eatery and resturanteur - casual and formal - has set up shop in Vancouver's most historic neighbourhood. Of note: L'Abattoir, Bauhaus, Birds and the Beets, Coquille, The Flying Pig, Meat and Bread, Old Spaghetti Factory, Pidgin and Tacofino. It's such a shame that the Crab Park Chowdery went the way of the dodo last year as their ""chowder"" options nicely complemented the rest of Gastown's foodie options. Regardless, whether you're looking for a romantic night out, or just a casual bite and drink, Gastown has more than enough to offer. For my money, the Old Spaghetti Factory is top notch and, in its own way, highlights some of Gastown's attractive character (see my earlier review on this site). Regardless of where you choose to go, though, all of these establishments are housed within the historic brick and timber buildings of the area.Gastown is also home to some of the Vancouver area's best shopping. With its fine and fair mix of the traditional touristy shops, independent fashion boutiques and First Peoples art galleries, you'll be sure to find something worthy to take home for friends and family. I mean, who wouldn't want some maple syrup or, more importantly, a miniature version of Gastown's famed Steam Clock? In all seriousness, there is some good shopping to be had here, including the flagship Fleuvog store.At day's end, what you decide to do in Gastown and how long you stay in the area is entirely up to you. It's Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood; it's full of vintage structures that call back to an earlier time; it's also shockingly modern in taste and appeal; and there's plenty to do for tourists of every stripe. Just want to visit the Steam Clock and Maple Tree Square for a quick selfie with Gassy Jack? That's fine. Want to patronize some restaurants and boutique stores? You can do that, too! Want to spend more time in the neighbourhood, take a ""Lost Souls of Gastown Tour"" and learn about its unique ghost lore? Awesome!

For those particularly keen on architecture and style, Gastown is rife with buildings reflective of the Victorian and Edwardian period, right down to the 100+ year-old lampposts that line the streets. If one is on a limited schedule, however, I would recommend visiting the Waterfront Station (technically on Gastown's border on Cordova), seeing the Byrnes Block building (built 1886) and viewing the Hotel Europe (built 1909). Each of these architectural gems have their own tales and help to give Gastown its historical character.Beyond the historical aspect, Gastown has become a cultural and foodie hub since its initial revitalization in the late 1970s and 1980s. For at least the last two decades, many an eatery and resturanteur - casual and formal - has set up shop in Vancouver's most historic neighbourhood. Of note: L'Abattoir, Bauhaus, Birds and the Beets, Coquille, The Flying Pig, Meat and Bread, Old Spaghetti Factory, Pidgin and Tacofino. It's such a shame that the Crab Park Chowdery went the way of the dodo last year as their ""chowder"" options nicely complemented the rest of Gastown's foodie options. Regardless, whether you're looking for a romantic night out, or just a casual bite and drink, Gastown has more than enough to offer. For my money, the Old Spaghetti Factory is top notch and, in its own way, highlights some of Gastown's attractive character (see my earlier review on this site). Regardless of where you choose to go, though, all of these establishments are housed within the historic brick and timber buildings of the area.Gastown is also home to some of the Vancouver area's best shopping. With its fine and fair mix of the traditional touristy shops, independent fashion boutiques and First Peoples art galleries, you'll be sure to find something worthy to take home for friends and family. I mean, who wouldn't want some maple syrup or, more importantly, a miniature version of Gastown's famed Steam Clock? In all seriousness, there is some good shopping to be had here, including the flagship Fleuvog store.At day's end, what you decide to do in Gastown and how long you stay in the area is entirely up to you. It's Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood; it's full of vintage structures that call back to an earlier time; it's also shockingly modern in taste and appeal; and there's plenty to do for tourists of every stripe. Just want to visit the Steam Clock and Maple Tree Square for a quick selfie with Gassy Jack? That's fine. Want to patronize some restaurants and boutique stores? You can do that, too! Want to spend more time in the neighbourhood, take a ""Lost Souls of Gastown Tour"" and learn about its unique ghost lore? Awesome!

Walk as far as the statue of Gassy Jack and then turn back and return to the city centre. There are some nice restaurants and bars around the Gastown block, For lunch, consider Steamworks or Rogue Kitchen (in the station building), Nicli Antica Pizzeria, Nuba or The Flying Pig.

The homeless in Gastown appear to comprise all races, genders and ages but the city seems to have given up and leaves them to fend for themselves.

It's got many touristy shops and prices to match. Traffic plows through unrelenting - wish the managers would make it foot traffic only, like towns in Europe. There is coffee (eg., Starbucks at the adjacent waterfront station, 😏), food, and views of the north shore (take the sea bus across to Lonsdale Quay just for the experience, and a cup-o-soup at the food court).

999,A Few Tips About Gastown,,"An iconic neighborhood in Vancouver and one of the first to exist from the 1860's. A lively place with a mixture of interesting souvenir shops, confectionaries, art boutiques and inviting restaurants. You know you are in Gastown when you see ""cobblestone streets,"" and the famous ""Steam Clock."" A nickname to one of the original saloon owners known as ""Gassy."" The name ""Gastown"" is a favorite visiting spot for both visitors and locals alike. Most of the original buildings were destroyed in the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886. A revitalization effort was begun in the 1960's to preserve what you see before you. There is still plenty of panache as you walk from one corner to another.On one corner is the famous ""Steam Clock,"" one of just a few still operating in the world. A whistle goes off every 15 minutes. Rarely will you ever have this corner by yourself as it is a favorite tourist mecca for selfies and videos. Gastown is located just a short distance from Canada Place where the Cruise ships dock. We also enjoyed exploring Granville Island. A farmers market is open every day selling most everything. We enjoyed the curry soup at Veggie Express this past visit. Walking around Gastown and Stanley Park were major highlights on our fourth visit to Vancouver. Also recommend finding the Marine Building and the ""Zeppelin"" relief sculpture. A free bus, too, can be had at Canada Place to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge which is located in north Vancouver. The ride is free, but the entrance fee to the park will be around $30.

1846,Gassy Jack lives on,,"Gastown is Vancouver's oldest neighborhood. The city started here with a single tavern founded by John 'Gassy Jack' Deighton in 1867. Apparently he was called gassy because he talked a lot not because he blew hot air from the other end. The former British sailor, river pilot and saloon keeper arrived with barrels of whiskey which made him a popular guy locally. There is a statue of him standing on a whiskey barrel in Maple Tree Square at Alexander and Powell Streets near the location of his first bar in Gastown.The area along Water Street with cobblestones and vintage lamp posts has had its ups and downs but today is lined with renovated old stone and brick buildings housing multiple souvenir shops, hi-end clothing boutiques, Inuit art outlets, galleries, restaurants and, of course, bars. There are walking tours for architecture and history buffs. A four-faced Steam Clock toots off the quarter hours and blows out a puff of steam on the hour at Cambie and Water Streets. It is usually surrounded by tourists so difficult to get a clean photo unless you arrive in the very early morning or buy a postcard. If you are in Vancouver it is worth a walk through Gastown.","June 15, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:44:39.045008,2021-06-18 19:44:39.132720,Gastown is Vancouver's oldest neighborhood.,is Vancouver's oldest neighborhood,0.9956145286560059,housing,neighborhood

Brick-paver sidewalks, antique-looking lampposts and cobblestone streets enhance the earlier-era ambiance. Maple Tree Square, mostly a busy intersection, is where Deighton built that salon and a statue of him stands there.

3039,How did Gastown get its name?,,"Gastown was the original name of our town. Named after Fraser River Captain John ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton, because he was the first settler on the site that would later become Vancouver. He was called gassy because he loved to""gas"", which in Victorian times meant to talk a lot, telling tales of his adventures in his bar, The Globe Saloon. Gassy Jack came from New Westminster in a dugout canoe with his Indian wife. While officially the town was called Granville, named after the Earl of Granville, the British colonial secretary, the locals rejected that and chose to call it Gastown, even on Admiralty charts. The newly incorporated City of Vancouver, burned to the ground in the Great Fire of June 13, 1886. Soon after moving into Deighton Hotel, 40 year old Jack lost his wife, and before she died, she arranged for him to marry her 12 year-old niece Qua-hail-ya or Madeline. The following year in 1871, she gave birth to a boy named Richard Mason after his uncle, Jack's late brother. Jack died at age 44 and left his estate to his three year-old son. Sadly the boy died six months after his father in November, 1875. Madeline lived to age 90, and died in 1948 on the North Vancouver Indian Reserve.","June 23, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 20:11:22.607972,2021-06-18 20:11:22.685423,Jack died at age 44 and left his estate to his three year-old son.,died at age 44 and left his estate to his three year-old son,0.9086199998855591,housing,estate

Maybe I'll have to work at changing that? After all, this neighbourhood is rife with history and remains home to some of Vancouver's best restaurants. How could one resist that?From a geographic perspective, Yaletown is typically framed as being east of Homer Street, between Robson Street and False Creek (see my earlier reviews of both on this site). In that respect, Yaletown is a fairly compact neighbourhood, though it is quite densely populated thanks to the new-ish high rise towers along the waterfront.

It's chic and a little up-scale, yes, but remains just as friendly as other areas of Vancouver.One of the most significant things I appreciate about Yaletown is its history. In its infancy, it was primarily a warehouse district and shipping area for trains; in fact, it was once the Western terminus for the CP Railway. In the early 20th century, when rail started giving way to trucking, Yaletown remained in a sort of stasis until Expo '86 arrived. When Vancouver played host to the World's Fair, the waterfront along False Creek - including sections of Yaletown - housed many of the venues for this historic event. The Expo, then, not only improved Vancouver's profile, but also provided the impetus for redeveloping and reimagining Yaletown.Indeed, it wasn't long after the Expo concluded that Yaletown began to see something of resurgence. Many of the warehouses and brick edifices were transformed and re-purposed into office space, residential lofts, cafes and boutique shops. The restaurants, in particular, highlight this wonderful synthesis of the classic and the modern: Most are situated in redbrick warehouses that were built with exterior platforms originally used to load and unload trains. In the current day, these platforms now function as year-round patios. Personally, I love it when we can incorporate our history into the present so seamlessly!Speaking of restaurants, as already noted, Yaletown is home to some of Vancouver's best:* Blue Water Cafe (Was ranked #1 on TripAdvisor for the longest time, but still remains in the top 10. It's also on my restaurant bucket list!)* Bistro Sakana (An excellent sushi restaurant that specializes in aburi sushi.

No major development, lots of old shop style merchants. If you can't find it on the drive it is probably not worth eating or drinking.

When you reach Venables St, it's all bad on both sides down to the harbor and it's all residential so there is nothing to see or buy.

201,Not really a tourist destination...,,"...Which is why I love it. For years I didn't get why people loved the drive so much, but that was because I lived and worked downtown. Moving out of the monoculture it still has taken a while to adjust. There are beggars. There are poor people. There are a fair few people who should probably not drink so early in the day and yes you can always smell someone smoking something 'fragrant'. But there is a fantastic community that lives and works together that is culturally, ethnically and socially diverse. That means you have a complete range of shops and services along the drive, and after a year there I am still discovering new gems all the time. Coming from London, it reminds me of Hackney in that sense. Not overly pretentious (you will find posers in all of Vancouver of course), it has a strong sense of heritage but not in a precious way - the Drive is constantly evolving.

We picked commercial drive because we wanted to be around the queer culture.Now, The Drive isn't somewhere I'd put on a ""must-see"" list if you're on a tight budget.

Tell anybody in the park that it's your first time on The Drive, and they'll probably let you hang out with them.Grab food from all over the world (which is notably absent in Vancover, compared to Toronto, in many other parts of the city).Walk around the streets, and check out the amazing backyard farms. Ask someone to show you around. They will.If you have time, spend at least 2-3 days here. If you are ""passing through,"" try chatting with some of the people who live here.

Panhandlers, skateboarders, junkies -- they're all there. If you're lucky, you'll spot author Chris Walter, whose novels chronicle the lifestyles of the down-and-out. Look for a tall bald guy covered in tattoos -- Vancouver's version of Hunter S. Thompson. Buy a copy of one of his books in any of the bookstores on The Drive, if you can find them -- they sell out quick at the used bookstores. You'll find out about the things the tourist guides DON'T want you to know.The food scene is eclectically good. Commercial used to be the Italian district, and there is a lingering whiff of Italia there, but mostly the eateries are diverse, funky and cheap (for Vancouver.) Great grocery stores too, everything from Middle Eastern to health food. Hardware to head shops, you can buy most anything you want. True local hang out and shop here.

0,Canada's Largest Chinatown,,"Ah, Chinatown! I think it's quite timely for the penning of this review. The current and ongoing pandemic adds another complex layer to this historic neighbourhood. Once described as an area ""humming busily for more than a century with vivid colours, exotic cuisine and a vibrant culture,"" the Chinatown of today is more reminiscent of a deteriorating ghost town. The streets are dirty, souvenir shops have been reduced to 2, windows are boarded up, and the vacancy rate currently sits at an elevated 17%. While still not nearly as bad as Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside, you'd probably be forgiven if you thought of the two neighborhoods as one and the same. They almost look it. Indeed, this ""decline"" has been happening for some time, but there can be little doubt that the COVID pandemic has accelerated and exasperated these sharp social cleavages.Vancouver's Chinatown wasn't always ""void of life.""

One very unfortunate feature, which has nothing to do with the Chinese cultural presence, is that a couple of the main streets (e.g. Hastings) are thronged with homeless people, to the extent that it was difficult to navigate the sidewalks at times.

87,Poo on you,,"What is a Chinatown? Historically, little more than a ghetto. Chinese people created self-sustaining communities not to impress tourists but because their lives were considered peripheral. Not unlike the Jewish or African American ghettos, Chinatowns exist because of discrimination and racism. Your complaint about Chinatown changing says more about you than about the neighborhood.When a ghetto changes, it means the people who lived there prospered themselves and their families, pushed through and overcame racism, and then moved to the suburbs. Now they have more lucrative businesses than their grandparents had. And that pisses off some people because it also means no more Orientalized ""Chinatown."" The Other is out of the Ghetto. I have always loved Chinatown in Vancouver and am thrilled to see all the new businesses there: independent, fun, creative, progressive businesses. Haunts of the moment include the Keefer bar, the Union, and Kissa Tanto. Phnom Penh is as great as it was 20 years ago, and worth every minute of that wait in line.Change means moving the Other out of the ghetto and allowing the ghetto to become a living, breathing architectural testimonial of history. And it's a scrumptious area, visually. A few buildings have been modified to the point where you kind of wish they had preserved more, but as much as possible new construction is integrated into the traditional architecture. The Jack Chow building. The Sun Yat-Sen philosopher-scholar gardens. The herb shops, the produce stands.Urine-scented alleyways, grunge, grime, and maybe even a few goobers of old man spittle on the ground now share space with world class cocktail bars and experimental restaurants. I miss the $3 congee as much as the next person. I mean, now I have to take the Skytrain all the way to Richmond to get a fix of traditional Chinese food. Anyone angry with their experience in Vancouver Chinatown is either not all that interested in actual Chinese culture, or are just really sketched out by poor people. They came expecting an Oriental Chinatown, the Disney version. If that's what you were hoping for, go to Epcot.For everyone else, see you at Matchstick during the day for a god shot of batch-roasted coffee. Then we can meet at the Union or Kissa Tanto for belly fills and cocktails. Or Phnom Penh if you don't mind waiting in line. Then if you're keen, we can catch a show up at the Rickshaw or lounge at the Keefer Bar.

Bamboo Village has opium pipes and unusual things tucked away in the back (e.g. Chinese Army helmets)8. try some food, steamed bakery items are popular9. be aware of your surroundings, it is a non-violent neighborhood but there is a bit of property theft so keep an eye on your stuff10. you will be approached by panhandlers but if you just say ""no"" firmly then they will not trouble you further.

Did you know that Chinatown is a tourist attraction and a thriving community?

I recently enjoyed a tour of the area with Judy Lam Maxwell and her Historical Chinatown Tours. Please see her listing for more info or search Chinatown girl Vancouver.After the tour, I gained an appreciation for the area. It's past, present and future. I could view the buildings with greater architectural appreciation. Look at the neon with new found love. Enjoy the bakeries, BBQ pork shops, and fruit & veggie stores knowing that this is a working neighborhood full of history, culture and people. Walk into the herbal shop to smell the ginsing and admire the dried mushrooms and strange sea creatures.Yes, I noticed that many of the store fronts are empty. But I also noticed that the area is being revitalized. Developers are saving the Victorian buildings and turning them into galleries, businesses, nouveau restaurants, reclaimed furniture stores and more. Mixed in are the traditional souvenir shops and older Chinese people living in the community. There are social clubs and people's lives hidden behind the doorways. But how can you expect to learn if you are just walking around aimlessly? Knowledge is power people!In my opinion, Chinatown is colourful, clean and exciting. On a Sunday afternoon, I did not feel threatened or scared. I highly recommend walking along the main streets of Pender and Keefer.

331,Devolution but still good,,"Vancouver's Chinatown is the second largest in North America, after San Francisco's iconic neighborhood comprised by those with Chinese ancestry. I had the good fortune to visit Vancouver 18 years ago, in 1997. The phenomenal growth throughout the rest of downtown in almost two decades astounded me. Skyscrapers next to English Bay remind me of Hong Kong. Visiting Chinatown was an easy walk from the Granville Street hotel. But that growth seems to have caused a demographic shift. Chinatown property owners resisted skyscraper development choosing instead to keep things the way they have been for decades: small buildings adjacent to sidewalks that border streets. Lack of development may have attracted the homeless and drug addicted population, though I saw that sad aspect only on side streets. I advise enjoying Chinatown sights only on Main Street. Use the same sensibilities you would in any large city's borderline community. NEVER wear gobs of jewelry and flash cash when traveling. Do you really need to impress anyone with a dozen credit cards or Rolex watch? A safety suggestion for any large city: If you feel threatened, walk into the street while checking for traffic. I did this on New York's Park Avenue one evening.Our 39-member tour group of mostly elderly people (meaning we felt safe and were not bothered) had several stops in Chinatown during our 3-day stay in Vancouver, Chinatown's Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden included. That Zen-like garden and the history we learned about how Chinese immigrants were instrumental to the development of the West Coast of Canada and America made me realize the mega cities lining the Pacific Ocean would not have occurred otherwise. Our tour included lunch at Jade Dynasty restaurant. I highly recommend the Dim Sum at Jade Dynasty. It was in Chinatown 18 years ago that I came across an idea: Use porcelain chopstick rests to place knives at a more formal dinner. I give a set of these to hosts when invited to dinner. Each host has appreciated the idea, and the tablecloth isn't stained.","October 10, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:15:06.127748,2021-06-19 08:15:06.215388,"Vancouver's Chinatown is the second largest in North America, after San Francisco's iconic neighborhood comprised by those with Chinese ancestry.","is the second largest in North America, after San Francisco's iconic neighborhood comprised by those with Chinese ancestry",0.9696996808052063,housing,neighborhood

I may have missed it but I didn't see lots of eateries or fresh food markets, which are 2 commonly found businesses in a typical overseas Chinese area. I passed by in the afternoon, and again early morning, on different days but the streets were not bustling - where has the people gone to, I wonder?

It is no longer the hub of ethnic life it once was since the Chinese have moved to the 'burbs like others who are upwardly mobile. What is left is the physical memory of a refuge for Chinese who found themselves ostracized by broader Vancouver society. Long since these dark and sad beginnings of the turn and early parts of the 20th Century, however, Chinatown is one of those places that has real character and the stones themselves tell stories.Geographically, to the north you find the poorest zip code in Canada. Hastings street is not where bright-eyed tourists want to be as it is populated by drug dealers and stumblebums. It is eye opening though. The Carnegie Community Centre at Main and Hastings used to be the posh centre of Vancouver, but now it is the epicentre of a down and out neighbourhood. To the west past Carral street you'll find gentrification and the sportsplexes of B.C. Stadium and Rogers Arena. There is a great Asian grocery store (T&T) at Abbott and Keefer as well as the International Village Mall near the skytrain. There is a skate park and playing field along Expo Blvd. If you keep on expo going south you will reach Science World.To the south is Prior Street and it is the southern reaches of Chinatown. There is a small Jimi Hendrix Shrine at Prior and Main. To the east is residential buildings. It's not really worth wandering past Gore Street, aka, church row where the First United Church and Christ Church of China serve the neighbourhood.So where are the good spots?The Stroll: There are fruit and vegetable markets, fishmongers, butcher shops, pastry shops, apothecaries (go in and check out the dried lizards, seahorses etc.), tea shops up and down Keefer and Pender. You would pretty much see everything by going down both streets between Abbot and Gore. It looks like Chinatown and smells like Chinatown. The buildings that will really bring you back to the day, however, is on Pender between Main & Columbia. Just look up and it will take you back a hundred years to the ""tongs"" or family associations. The Sun Yat San Gardens just a few steps further on Pender has a free walled garden area worth looking into and is quite nice. You can pay to tour the garden house part of the site if you are so inclined. Check out the narrowest building in Vancouver on Pender and Carral on your way to the Welcome Arch further down towards the west. There is also a monument to the Chinese Canadian Soldiers who served in the Canadian military during the wars at Columbia and Keefer. These guys paved the way for the Chinese to finally become citizens of Canada.The Food: Massive lunch Dim Sum place at the Floata (in the big building at Columbia and Keefer). If you like Asian style tea joints (serving fusion style western and Asian) hit up Maxim's (Keefer & Gore). Try the beef tongue spaghetti. Asian style diners are everywhere but I recommend Kam Gok Yuen (on Pender near Keefer). My favourite, however, is the always busy Cambodian restaurant Pnom Penh on the southside of Georgia between Gore and Main. I highly recommend their chicken wings, butter beef (rare beef smothered in cilantro, garlic & oil), beef on rice or lemon grass chicken on rice. If you crave a western meal, Save on Meats is on Hastings and Meat & Bread just a bit beyond Chinatown - both are great!Chinatown is great for an edgy cultural experience.

There is a great Asian grocery store (T&T) at Abbott and Keefer as well as the International Village Mall near the skytrain. There is a skate park and playing field along Expo Blvd. If you keep on expo going south you will reach Science World.To the south is Prior Street and it is the southern reaches of Chinatown. There is a small Jimi Hendrix Shrine at Prior and Main. To the east is residential buildings. It's not really worth wandering past Gore Street, aka, church row where the First United Church and Christ Church of China serve the neighbourhood.So where are the good spots?The Stroll: There are fruit and vegetable markets, fishmongers, butcher shops, pastry shops, apothecaries (go in and check out the dried lizards, seahorses etc.), tea shops up and down Keefer and Pender. You would pretty much see everything by going down both streets between Abbot and Gore. It looks like Chinatown and smells like Chinatown. The buildings that will really bring you back to the day, however, is on Pender between Main & Columbia.

The Sun Yat San Gardens just a few steps further on Pender has a free walled garden area worth looking into and is quite nice. You can pay to tour the garden house part of the site if you are so inclined. Check out the narrowest building in Vancouver on Pender and Carral on your way to the Welcome Arch further down towards the west. There is also a monument to the Chinese Canadian Soldiers who served in the Canadian military during the wars at Columbia and Keefer.

Asian style diners are everywhere but I recommend Kam Gok Yuen (on Pender near Keefer). My favourite, however, is the always busy Cambodian restaurant Pnom Penh on the southside of Georgia between Gore and Main. I highly recommend their chicken wings, butter beef (rare beef smothered in cilantro, garlic & oil), beef on rice or lemon grass chicken on rice.

482,Slipping away....,,"Visiting after a two year's absence was very shocking. Many of the vibrant businesses are gone now, many empty stores. For once it was easy to get a parking space! The Night Market has relocated to Richmond, where is apparently where all the Asian business has gone to. It's such a shame as there is so much history in this area, and it looks like the city is just letting it decline. One block is being torn down to raise new multifloor apartments/condos, and that's probably what will happen to the entire area eventually! It is sketchy in the area, but if you go during day hours and stay around the open businesses, it'll be fine. There are still ""jewels"" there like the Sun Yat Sen Classical garden which we always love to visit. And the Flota Restaurant & Hon Restaurant are still there. We're just so sad to see the change!

The Sun Yat Sen Garden (paid admission) has a charming free park; the entry is to the left as you enter the courtyard off of Pender Street. We also enjoyed the many markets for fruit, vegetables, dried food items, and other Oriental specialties. We sampled new Town Bakery and Restaurant's (Pender St) mooncakes with red bean paste, and enjoyed lunch at Phnom Penh Restaurant (on Georgia). Altogether worth a pleasant couple of hours.
