Not impressed at all,,"Perhaps it was because our visit was on a rainy weekday evening, but I was underwhelmed by Gastown.   Most of the stores were closed, except for a few selling souvenirs.

Fun time in Gastown!,,"We visited Vancouver in April 2019 and loved Gastown with it's historic streets, great shops, coffee shops and pubs. The Gastown Steam Clock is a must see, make sure you are there on the hour when the clock whistles and puff steam from its top. Gastown is where the pioneers named the city Vancouver in 1885. Gastown was named after the founding father, ""Gassy Jack"" John Deighton, the Deighton House Hotel saloonkeeper known for his 'Gassy' monologues.

A Contrast to the ambiance of Robson Street,,"This area is more quaint and less metropolitan than Robson Street.It is the original settlement that became the core of the creation of Vancouver and is named for ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton, a Yorkshire seaman, steamboat captain and barkeep who arrived in 1867 to open the area's first saloon. He was famous for his habit of talking at length (or ""gassing"").It has distinctive and historic architecture that is a little quaint, the streets are cobblestones and narrower than other areas and this gives it a personable atmosphere. It is a mix of ""hip"" contemporary fashion and interior furnishing boutiques, tourist-oriented businesses (generally restricted to Water Street), restaurants, nightclubs, poverty and newly upscale housing. In addition, there are law firms, architects and other professional offices, as well as computer and internet businesses, art galleries, music and art studios, tattoo parlors, and acting and film schools.","July 30, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:08:52.950007,2021-06-18 19:08:53.042171

We were sorely disappointed. The cobblestone streets and hanging flower baskets were pretty, but couldn't distract from feeling completely unsafe in the area. We saw (literally) hundreds of homeless people / addicts as we were driving in and on the surrounding streets after we parked and tried to make our way to Water Street. Once we finally made it (treading carefully over all the used needles), the smell of urine and weed on in Gastown did not help our nerves.

The Original Vancouver,,"Gastown is Vancouver’s most historic district and neighbourhood and was finally designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2009. Named after John “Gassy Jack” Deighton, this area of Vancouver is unique for its ability to maintain its historic charm while concomitantly looking forward towards the future. In other words, Gastown is able to provide a near-perfect synthesis of the old and new: Victorian and Edwardian-era architecture meets contemporary and chic boutiques, shops and restaurants. Because of this, any visit to Vancouver would ultimately be incomplete without some time spent in and around Gastown. It is home to some of the best the city has to offer, and it does all of this in a truly unique – attractive – environment.History is perhaps one of the primary reasons one might have for an initial visit to Gastown; and, believe me, this area has plenty of it. Established in and around 1867, when John Deighton sought to open a saloon (and did so within 24 hours!), Gastown very quickly became the fledgling city’s trading, commerce, cultural and social hub. Because of its proximity to the waterfront, Gastown proved to be an ideal location for business to take root. With the influx of workers to the area, many a hotel, eatery and pub popped up, creating what I’m sure was an interesting cultural mosaic of sorts. In this respect, one could argue that the area essentially functioned as Vancouver’s original downtown core.In fact, it was exactly because of all the hustle and bustle that Vancouver city council held their first official meeting in Gastown, specifically Maple Tree Square (see my earlier review on this site), following incorporation in 1886. Unfortunately, most of the original Gastown burned to the ground barely two months later in what has been dubbed the Great Fire of 1886. Not to be dissuaded, though, Gastown was very quickly rebuilt and, today, the majority of the buildings that stand in this neighbourhood date from 1886 to 1914, giving us a beautiful historic window into the past. For those particularly keen on architecture and style, Gastown is rife with buildings reflective of the Victorian and Edwardian period, right down to the 100+ year-old lampposts that line the streets. If one is on a limited schedule, however, I would recommend visiting the Waterfront Station (technically on Gastown’s border on Cordova), seeing the Byrnes Block building (built 1886) and viewing the Hotel Europe (built 1909). Each of these architectural gems have their own tales and help to give Gastown its historical character.Beyond the historical aspect, Gastown has become a cultural and foodie hub since its initial revitalization in the late 1970s and 1980s. For at least the last two decades, many an eatery and resturanteur – casual and formal – has set up shop in Vancouver’s most historic neighbourhood. Of note: L’Abattoir, Bauhaus, Birds and the Beets, Coquille, The Flying Pig, Meat and Bread, Old Spaghetti Factory, Pidgin and Tacofino. It’s such a shame that the Crab Park Chowdery went the way of the dodo last year as their “chowder” options nicely complemented the rest of Gastown’s foodie options. Regardless, whether you’re looking for a romantic night out, or just a casual bite and drink, Gastown has more than enough to offer. For my money, the Old Spaghetti Factory is top notch and, in its own way, highlights some of Gastown’s attractive character (see my earlier review on this site). Regardless of where you choose to go, though, all of these establishments are housed within the historic brick and timber buildings of the area.Gastown is also home to some of the Vancouver area’s best shopping. With its fine and fair mix of the traditional touristy shops, independent fashion boutiques and First Peoples art galleries, you’ll be sure to find something worthy to take home for friends and family. I mean, who wouldn’t want some maple syrup or, more importantly, a miniature version of Gastown’s famed Steam Clock? In all seriousness, there is some good shopping to be had here, including the flagship Fleuvog store.At day’s end, what you decide to do in Gastown and how long you stay in the area is entirely up to you. It’s Vancouver’s oldest neighbourhood; it’s full of vintage structures that call back to an earlier time; it’s also shockingly modern in taste and appeal; and there’s plenty to do for tourists of every stripe. Just want to visit the Steam Clock and Maple Tree Square for a quick selfie with Gassy Jack? That’s fine. Want to patronize some restaurants and boutique stores? You can do that, too! Want to spend more time in the neighbourhood, take a “Lost Souls of Gastown Tour” and learn about its unique ghost lore? Awesome! There’s just no shortage of things to do and it is for that reason that Gastown is a “must visit” when in Vancouver.​","February 12, 2020",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:09:04.645956,2021-06-18 19:09:04.728780

Good Old Vancouver.,,"We walked in to Gastown from the Waterfront Station to have a look at the Steam Clock. It is fascinating to watch when it blows it’s whistle and sounds like a hissing Big Ben. We had to wait for some time before it blew so we had a small walk around Gastown.Gastown is one of the first settlements which gave rise to the city of Vancouver around the 1860s. Since then it has metamorphosed a number of times from a centre for trade and commerce to an area of warehouses to load logs and timber. Later it became the centre for the city’s wholesale produce distribution, and also the centre of the city’s drinking life. After the depression the area went into decline and came to be known as the Skid Row. After the 1970s Gastown has been slowly rehabilitated and now has a number of respectable businesses like fashion and interior décor boutiques, restaurants, nightclubs, bars as well as professional offices of law firms, architects and computer firms, music and art studios and film and acting schools, and a few art galleries. Of course, there are still some areas in Gastown where we saw some destitute people begging or just hanging around the streets. It is best to avoid these areas after late evening.We enjoyed our short walk and had a good look at some of the old heritage buildings lining the cobbled sidewalks.

The homelessness and drug problem of East Hastings has spread into surrounding areas including Gastown.  The antique shops have been replaced by tawdry souvenir shops.  The streets are littered with debris including cigarette butts, ancient pieces of gum, and needles.  Everywhere smells like urine and I no longer feel entirely safe there especially at night.

Start at the corner of Cordova and Water Street and walk slowly down towards the The Steam Clock, which always gets attention in the middle of Water Street. However, the challenge for tourists is not to wander too far and into the troubled Downtown Eastside area where the ambience quickly changes from urban chic to grungy unpleasantness with alarming scenes of drug addiction, homelessness and squalid street-culture. Walk as far as the statue of Gassy Jack and then turn back and return to the city centre. There are some nice restaurants and bars around the Gastown block, For lunch, consider Steamworks or Rogue Kitchen (in the station building), Nicli Antica Pizzeria, Nuba or The Flying Pig. For evenings, check out the Pourhouse, Water Street Cafe, Jules Bistro, Bauhaus and L'Abattoir.  There are many others, but these all deliver a quality experience.

A National Historic Site of Canada (2009),,"Who can argue with that?  Smarter people (than we are) presumably know what merits this distinction and honor.  The community nearly vaporized during the 1886 ""Great Vancouver Fire"" which, when the embers burnt out, reduced all but 2 buildings to ash.  But 1886 is not like yesterday and the town rebuilt in a mish-mash of Victorian Italianate, Edwardian, and Romanesque.  The community has fiercely fought to preserve these roots.  This is a pleasant respite from the glass modern towers which make their home throughout Vancouver.Our favorites were a fun little souvenir shop (oh well, we are tourists, after all) and the landmarks of the steam clock and Gassy Jack, and the hanging flower baskets, suspended from the white glass globed lamp posts (evoking the 1880's period).  The overall impression was that the 1880's were alive and well here in Gastown.An amusing factoid is that in 1971 there was a riot between police and hippies over marijuana.  Fast-forward to the here-and-now and it is legal; eating it, as well, becomes legal later in August of 2019.  Who would have guessed?  Times change.

Touristy Area But Worry Visiting,,We went to Gastown to have lunch and to shop.  Parking can be a challenge and it was easier to park in public garage (a challenge for larger vehicles though).There are lots of options for food and shopping.  The steam clock is unique and definitely allow time to watch it play the whistles (every 45 minutes I think).  There was an extremely good artist painting and selling local art near the clock.  His work is excellent and he signed the painting we bought of the steam clock.We ate at The Lamplighter Public House and it was very good.  The shops are a mix of touristy souvenirs and eclectic options.  There is a lot of interesting history on the area and worth checking out the various plaques and markers to learn more about the area.Do note that the area adjacent to Gastown has a large homeless and transient population.

He was targeting women. One thing I did not see was any police presence in that area. I think that would be necessary. However I did see a large police presence at the Starbucks...Hmmmm.

I have felt safer on the streets of Dublin, Edinburgh, & London than I did in Gastown on a Sunday evening. We were accosted by 2 homeless people and approached by several others. We had just arrived and had no cash on hand when one man asked for change. We politely told him so and he asked for my credit card. The entire area reeked of urine and just a few blocks over is an entire tent city of homeless. This does not make for a pleasant tourist attraction.

The buildings, the streets, the chained linked sidewalks. Make sure to go early, because the shops close around 7, then mostly restaurants and pubs are open. The highlight is the clock, even though it was built in the 70’s, it still felt pretty old. It was so charming every time it chimed, which is every 15 minutes. We sat at the restaurant across from it to enjoy it fully. We were so lucky to be there when the Raptors won, made it even more exciting to be there.

homeless problem,,"Named after a Yorkshire captain and resident, ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton this is a gentrified neighborhood of old buildings, boutiques, coffee shops, ethnic eateries and gastropubs.  Not that different from hundreds of places across Europe/Americas... what makes it different is the legion of homeless lining the streets, screaming, mumbling, lying in torpor on doorsteps, waiting in long lines at soup kitchens. The local hipsters do not seem to think twice about them as they step over the bodies and evade the inebriated/stoned. The homeless in Gastown appear to comprise all races, genders and ages but the city seems to have given up and leaves them to fend for themselves. I've heard a lot of screaming but no violence which I guess is good but overall this is much worse than Santa Monica or Tenderloin... which says a lot. For me, seeing the suffering on the streets together with the apparent absence of an organized city-wide response seemed pretty dispiriting. No amount of good food and entertainment can compensate for it.","April 29, 2019",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:15:40.745038,2021-06-18 19:15:40.824436

Nice place but bad neighberhood,,"We are currently on a trip through the West of Canada. We started the trip in Vancouver. We visited the City about 10 years ago already. We already knew the neighborhood of the historic Gastown is bad. We hoped this has been improved since then but we just found out it got even worse. In case you plan to walk from Gastown to China Town you will go through a dangerous area with Junkies and strange people looking for rests of cigarettes, asking for money to buy drogs, shouting around, checking you out...If you are young and healthy: Watch your back. If you are a bit older or anxious: Call for a Taxi. Gastown is nice but keep on the main street and don‘t go to some of the smaller streets in the neighborhood. I don‘t understand why the City of Vancouver still concentrates all these problems in a small spot. Other cities around the world have tried this and failed. I expected the Chinese would take care of this situation and keep China Town clean. But it is actually the other way around. Also China Town is going down. The Drugs and the dirt are taking over command. China Town in Vancouver is not a nice place anymore.","April 26, 2019",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:15:50.509309,2021-06-18 19:15:50.589340

My FAVORITE thing about Gastown is LIQUID AMBER, which is my tattoo shop!  The artists there are amazing and I've had two tattoos by Nicki Lochmatter that are totally killer!

Like any old restoration there is room for improvement,,"No doubt Gastown is a must visit. it is the old part of Vancouver going back to the day Skids were on the muddy streets wherein Skid Row was founded. The older of Vancouver buildings restored and modernized inside with Yuppie offices, clubs, lofts, and tourist gift options. The massive Cruise Trade docks just next door and spill out of visitors establishes Gastown as a walkabout location to pick up both cheap and expensive gift items. It also allows for some local eateries to satisfy the cravings and has some built in attractions such as the Vancouver Steam Clock. All a good use of time. The home of Gassy Jack who built a local bar and hotel as well as the city's first jail. Unfortunately it sits all on the edge of our street society with their drugs and needles et al. You shouldn't run into any but it can happen when they spill over into the new Gentry of Gastown. If you have the time it is a short walk to old China Town as well. All worth a look.

Overrated,,"Gastown is rightfully a source of pride in Vancouver. It was rescued from the wrecking ball by conscientious citizens, but sadly it needs another dose of that kind of civic pride.Gastown is about a 4 square block area of buildings from the late 1900s. There are many  charming structures among them. Unfortunately, we had the sense that this area is on the decline. It was the most run down part of Vancouver by far during our visit, with lots of graffiti, trash blowing around, and just general wear along the streets. There were many empty storefronts and lots of souvenir shops selling pretty much the same merchandise. It was kind of a disappointment even though we generally like to visit historic old towns.Having said all of that, the steam clock is kind of cool. There are also a larger number of interesting independent stores toward the east end of the neighborhood (find the steam clock and just enjoy the next three blocks or so as you walk eastward.Be sure to stop in the Eames furniture store, which is almost like a museum of modern furniture and has lots of cool stuff even if you can't afford it or can't quite imagine seeing it in your home.","March 19, 2019",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:16:22.176697,2021-06-18 19:16:22.257834

Worth a Short Visit,,"We strolled through Gastown on a Monday morning in mid-March so it certainly wasn't as vibrant and lively at this time of day/year as I imagine it would be at other times. There certainly are some unique one-off stores/restaurants/coffee shops worth visiting. There are also a fair number of same-'ol tourist stores. If you have a number of days to spend in Vancouver it would be worth a visit, for sure but if you're tight for time I would not make it a priority. And be aware where you're walking as the edge of Gastown skirts the downtown east side, so you certainly see a element of that part of the population spill over.","March 16, 2019",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:16:22.339998,2021-06-18 19:16:22.421805

Good but be careful!,,"Gastown is a really great piece of Vancouver history and it is easy to get to by downtown and the cruise ship terminal.

"Beautiful Historic Buildings, Cute Shops, Unique Steam Clock, Good Photo Opportunities & Delicious Food!",,"Gastown is a popular area in Vancouver that is worth exploring. It is one of the oldest area of the city with the charming cobblestone streets lined with historic brick warehouses which have been renovated and restored and now house upscale restaurants, boutiques, trendy shops, and souvenir shops. The neighbourhood was close to downtown, making it accessible. It was a small area and was easy to explore on foot. I enjoyed walking the streets and browsing the shops during my visit in May 2017 along with photographing the beautiful architecture.Water Street was the main street through Gastown. It had some great photo opportunities and was picturesque. The Steam Clock is a popular attraction at the corner of Water and Cambrie Streets, which lets off steam from the top every 15 minutes or so and plays a short song. It was pretty crowded there but still a good place to take a photo and check it out. I felt safe wandering around in Gastown during the day but would advise against going here in the later evening or at night. It was very close to the Upper East Side, known for its high number of drug users, and they have been known to hang out in Gastown as well. There is a delicious vegan restaurant in the neighbourhood called Meet in Gastown, which had a great selection of amazing plant-based food. I would recommend checking out Gastown when in Vancouver.","November 18, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:17:40.627651,2021-06-18 19:17:40.718607

"Beautiful buildings, Unique Clock and Yummy food!",,"Vancouver is a cultured place with lots of different things to do and see, including, Gastown. Some of my family and I (group of 7) just felt like walking around and site seeing. We decided on Gastown, which I fully suggest! we had a great time! there are many stores to look at and go into, as well as many restaurants. there is also the famous Steam Clock that is a must see for sure. it is a short stop, as there are usually many people gathered around (although it is a nice place for a family picture). after seeing most of the sites (probably around 2h) it was supper time to we decided on ""The Old Spaghetti Factory"". It was packed, so I would suggest having supper before or after 6:30). However, we where unable to make reservations they only took ""walk in's"". although there many people waiting before us we where still seated sooner than expected. with an hour to eat, It took around 3 hours all together. This includes almost all walking so be sure to where walking shoes and bring a camera for all the interesting architecture and designing on the buildings and clock. Overall, fully suggest this as a tourist stop, especially if you want time to just enjoy the walk and surroundings.","November 12, 2018",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:17:52.256513,2021-06-18 19:17:52.346550

Not a tourist trap any longer,,"I have lived in Vancouver for over 50 years and for much of this time Gastown had a reputation with the locals as a tourist trap with just a few good restaurants.  I was down there recently, with people from out of town and I must say that Gastown has had a rebirth.  It's probably been trendy for years already but I am just starting to go out more now that my kids have become more independent.  There are many good restaurants in Gastown now.  There are also a lot of nice shops (Oak + Fort, Herschel, and many others).  There are still a few tourist shops that sell mainly souvenirs but they are now in the minority.  For shoe lovers, do not miss Fluevog shoes.  Some unique designs that will be immediately recognized by shoe aficionados and very well made and comfortable shoes.

Had a nice refreshing drink at a quaint little cafe run by two gents, names Carlos and Peter and then headed for ho e. That was when we began to notice a huge influx of what I could only describe as undesirable drifters and the smell of cannabis filled the air and our lungs. Bohemian, it was not!

To be honest, Vancouver is more of a gateway to other parts of BC to visit, so in terms of sights I find Gastown to be below average, if you want to compare old parts of other cities such as Toronto, Montreal or Quebec City, Gastown doesn't even compare.

If you walk too much west you will end up in the Downtown Eastside neighborhood famed for poverty, homelessness and drug use. A unusual attraction is the steam powered clock.","June 24, 2018",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:24:14.200595,2021-06-18 19:24:14.290135

"Grotty, smelly and touristy",,"After 2 days of sightseeing in gorgeous Vancouver, we thought we should go and see Gastown. How hideous!Basically Gastown consists of one strip of shops a couple of blocks long with the majority being really cheap and nasty tourist shops. Loads of pubs (that actually looked quite good) but why would you bother when Vancouver is full of pubs?But it was crack heaven. We couldn't walk a couple of metres before being accosted by someone wanting money. And the smell is horrendous - piss and crap in every doorway and laneway. Empty shops galore and I can see why. And for your own safety, DON'T stray off the main street because it is 10 times worse on any of the adjacent streets as you move away from the harbour - more crackheads, empty shops and boarded up buildings. But the thing that gets me is that everyone lines up to see the Steam Clock which was built to replicate an 1850s original was actually built in the 1970s (to fool the tourists I suspect) and the ""cobbled"" streets are just new pavers laid poorly enough to jump out of the road every time a car drives by.The best thing about Gastown is the gorgeous 1914 Waterfront Station which was beautifully restored inside and the John Fluevog store with its amazing interior architecture and out of this world shoes.I note that some people who visited in the same week as me have left fabulous reviews but I honestly can't imagine how anyone could enjoy what we saw today.","June 9, 2018",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 19:25:05.379109,2021-06-18 19:25:05.457844

Seedy/pretentious,,"Just come back from a lovely stay in Sechelt, visited Gastown amongst all the other popular areas within Vancouver too. Bitterly disappointed with this place, the street lamps and a handful of shops are nice but overall unfortunately the area is ruined by the vast amount of homeless people pushing trolleys of their belongings around the streets and congregating on urine covered pavements to sell and take drugs. The sights were truly horrible, the amount of people I walked past with ‘track lines’ up their arms which had become infected, people missing limbs no doubt as a result of drug abuse, shouting, swearing and walking around not fully clothed was shocking. We genuinely felt unsafe, you take one wrong turn and you’re faced with some really disturbing sights. My only advice would be, yes go and see for yourself, go in broad daylight but definitely Don’t take kids. Anyone who failed to notice this on their trip must walk around with rose tinted specs!","May 9, 2018",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:26:06.221698,2021-06-18 19:26:06.344638

A Few Tips About Gastown,,"An iconic neighborhood in Vancouver and one of the first to exist from the 1860’s.    A lively place with a mixture of interesting souvenir shops, confectionaries, art boutiques and inviting restaurants.  You know you are in Gastown when you see “cobblestone streets,” and the famous “Steam Clock.”  A nickname to one of the original saloon owners known as “Gassy.” The name “Gastown” is a favorite visiting spot for both visitors and locals alike. Most of the original buildings were destroyed in the Great Vancouver Fire of 1886. A revitalization effort was begun in the 1960’s to preserve what you see before you.  There is still plenty of panache as you walk from one corner to another.On one corner is the famous “Steam Clock,” one of just a few still operating in the world.  A whistle goes off every 15 minutes.  Rarely will you ever have this corner by yourself as it is a favorite tourist mecca for selfies and videos. Gastown is located just a short distance from Canada Place where the Cruise ships dock.  We also enjoyed exploring Granville Island.   A farmers market is open every day selling most everything.  We enjoyed the curry soup at Veggie Express this past visit.  Walking around Gastown and Stanley Park were major highlights on our fourth visit to Vancouver.  Also recommend finding the Marine Building and the “Zeppelin” relief sculpture.  A free bus, too, can be had at Canada Place to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge which is located in north Vancouver.  The ride is free, but the entrance fee to the park will be around $30.

Gastown is where you'll find the old town of Vancouver with its heritage brick buildings, historic character, tourist shops and fine restaurants. It was transformed from what once was a grubby rough area into a popular tourist destination with popular shops and restaurants. Gastown's main thoroughfare, Water Street, is lined with quaint shops, including great tourist souvenir ones and excellent restaurants. The steam powered clock on Water Street is a Vancouver landmark and tourist attraction. It is powered by an underground steam system that also powers some of the nearby buildings.

Historic Steam Clock is a fun thing to check off your list,,"We enjoyed our walk through historic Gastown’s cobbled streets, the first settlement in Vancouver. The Globe Saloon was opened in 1867 by John “Gassy Jack” Deighton. Apparently the drinkers thought enough of “Gassy Jack” to name a town after him.  We walked past trendy restaurants on the way to the famous Gastown Whistling Steam Clock that pumps real steam through a mechanism that plays a song every 15 minutes. The steam comes from a series of underground steam pipes that provide heat to most of downtown Vancouver but the “steam clock” is not technically steam powered, the clockworks are actually powered by descending weights. Curious tourists like ourselves lined up to see the iconic clock puff and sing its short musical notes on the quarter hour. That done we walked back to the hotel for a good nights sleep.","January 10, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:28:20.713274,2021-06-18 19:28:20.792934

Much different than I recall (in a bad way),,"Had I left a review from many years ago, it might have received a 5  star review for it's eclectic vibe and fun atmosphere. Granted I was a single guy back in those days and clubs like Notorious and Richards on Richards were a single guys playground. Sadly the intervening years has seen what appears to be an explosion of homelessness that did not exist on my first visit. Additionally the streets are riddled with filth from the aforementioned people using the streets as their bathroom and drug dens. Many a junkie is trying to beg for money to score their next fix. Thus such environments are not safe for unsuspecting tourists who wouldn't expect to be harassed or accosted while walking through a sight seeing place. Sadly the aforementioned bars are gone, and bouncers at various clubs look to keep the dopers out to prevent tourists from fleeing. Poor city governance from the local politicians is likely what is responsible for this bad situation.","January 9, 2018",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:28:20.952553,2021-06-18 19:28:21.033167

We Love Gastown!,,"Maybe it’s a touristy place, I agree. But I saw lots of local folks in the bars and restaurants there. The steam clock is fun to see and people are always taking pictures of it. The poor thing took a hard hit probably New Year’s Eve, cracking the glass panel on one side. May happen all the time for all I know.Steamworks brewing is definitely worth a visit. Place is much bigger inside than one would guess. We had good food there and service very friendly. No problems at all. Check the downstairs. We also hit several shops and the local beer Mecca, The Lamplighter. Food was surprisingly good and it looks like they probably have 30 taps or more (I was too lazy to count). Gastown was a very easy walk from our hotel downtown (Four Seasons). The hop-on-hop-off bus also goes right through the heart of it. If you’re headed for Chinatown, it’s just a few minutes walk (through an admittedly sketchy no mans land). The Sun Yat-sen park / garden is well worth seeing, but wait for spring; not quite so pretty in the winter. The streets, historic brick buildings, tree lined sidewalks, proximity to the water, diverse food and drink, and overall vibe make this place very special and absolutely worth a visit.","January 5, 2018",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:28:31.428567,2021-06-18 19:28:31.507865

It's a strange mix however considering no more than a few blocks over is Hastings Street, where you can see the truly downtrodden of Vancouver.

Extremely contradictory,,"Gastown is an extremely contradictory area. On the other hand it's a very beautiful old district with lovely houses, restaurants and lots of gift shops, but on the other hand it's part of Eastside Downtown, which is the area of the less fortunate. Because the so-called four blocks of hell are right next to the tourist streets, there are a lot of addicts, mental patients, prostitutes etc. also in the tourist area of Gastown. Some people might find it disturbing. For me it was just a shock to see them in the city that is supposed to be one of the best when it comes to quality of life. Overall street homelessness is a very visible phenomenon in downtown Vancouver. As a single female traveller I accidentally ended up in the four blocks of hell in the daylight. I wasn't threatened in any way, but it was an eye-opening experience, which made me think how lucky I was.","September 27, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:33:08.349779,2021-06-18 19:33:08.428144

If you have not seen any other old towns ..,,"... this can become your favorite place. Unfortunately, if you had a chance to visit some of America's or European downtown (like Seattle, San Francisco, Rome, Amsterdam, Berlin) this will be just an average old location in some city. There are few things to see like old steam clock that wakes ups everyone on few streets or blocks away (including very 'friendly' people on the East Hastings); few stores with souvenirs that are very cheaply and bulk made (like coffee mugs, hats, fridge magnets) and owned by one person (yes, you can get the same coffee mag cheaper in one another store few meters away), some old buildings that can be used as a good background for photography, few very expensive stores, one parkade, few restaurants that can feed you quickly and cheaply but that's about it; some number of bars with outdoor patio you can enjoy during non-pouring-bad-rainy days... Yes, streets are older and fairly good maintained for their age but that's about it. Make yourself a favor, walk the Gastown once up and down on opposite side of the street, get a quick coffee and catch a hop-on bus to get to English Bay, or Kits beach, go to the Capilano suspension bridge or take a short (or long) walk close to the ocean and enjoy it. I would strongly recommend visiting Richmond's Steveston area if you have few hours to spend.Far better way of spending valuable tourist time than buying souvenirs in Gastown overpriced shops and wait for a seat in any Gastown restaurant during 2 hrs lunch breaks. Yes, someone would say that Gastown is unique.. It is but it is also a place to which you are not coming back for a reason. You might stumble up on it again... Once you see it you can check it off from your Vancouver to-do list.","September 14, 2017",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:34:26.396390,2021-06-18 19:34:26.471997

"Can a street violate a ""Best before"" label.",,"Since I'm getting to be older than some cosmic constellations, I remember well when Gastown was fresh and lively and new in it's oldness.

The Spaghetti Factory was THE place to go for grub and the crackheads pissing on the lamposts were far into the future, like 1995. Make a wrong turn off Water street and meet an ugly truth of Vancouver, the zombie apocalypse stretch of East Hastings skid row. I travel through Gastown about twice a week at around 7 AM. That's about the time most of the zombies have vacated most of Gastown and retreated back a block or two, leaving others to clean up the garbage of dumped cans in the search of bottles and to pick up the used hypo-needles that litter every dark corner.Avoid this place.","August 31, 2017",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 19:36:02.499561,2021-06-18 19:36:02.584551

Hobnobbing with the Bourgeois,,"City brochures should feature Gastown under the headline, ""Come See Gentrification at Work!"" The block-to-block juxtaposition of clean, high-quality, trendy establishments alongside the skiddest of Skid Rows full of drinking holes, hourly motels and cheap calorie dispensaries (these places barely qualify as ""eateries"") will ensure that only the most jaded and/or willfully ignorant fail to contemplate the cost-benefit ratio of gentrification. High quality services, upscale apartments and top-flight restaurants mean better jobs, safer streets and a high standard of living, but at what cost? And for whom? I haven't been to a city where the tony and the downtrodden exist in such numbers and in such close proximity as to be mentally jarring. I walked from Water St., to Carrall St. and then down Powell St. over to Main to catch a bus. (This was around sunset and I grew up in a very rough part of a city, so I was OK, but I would not recommend this for families or anybody who doesn't know how to handle themselves.) It was like walking from one city into a completely different one, from the First World into a developing country. How do we make sure that folks who are barely hanging on get lifted up as the rents rise and the job opportunities improve? How can I make choices that do not exclude those who need help and resources most of all?

"""Good for souvenir shopping""",,"A friend & I took the Seabus (overcrowded & overpriced ripoff) from Downtown Vancouver  to the Gastown area.  Unfortunately (due to overpriced parking fees) we only had 3 hours there so it went by too quickly.  We did see the historic Steam Clock and could see the busy area had lots of potential for walking, shopping and eating but we barely had time to go to 3 souvenir shops, take some quick photos, & see the Clock. I must warn visitors of the souvenir shops. Don't be fooled by big signs of ""30 % off"" like at the  C & K World Handbags  on Water St.  The saleslady was ""too friendly"" and made you think you were getting the best deal-& there were plenty of great souvenirs to choose from-but if you go check out the prices at other stores, they are lower than the jacked up then ""discounted"" ones there..  Also, in Suraj Fashion & Gifts on Water St., the salesman actually asked me to hand over my credit card-NO ONE ELSE DID THAT-(I could kick myself for not refusing at the time, was just surprised) and he was the one who handled it, looked at it, put it in his mobile credit card reader, answered ""yes"" when it asks if the total is correct, which I assume by law is only supposed to be done by the card owner, and didn't even thank me for the purchase.. I was quite concerned later that  there'd be a fraudulent charge on my card due to this suspicious behavior (so far ok).  I would recommend skipping this shop since there are better options.  The best souvenir shop was Smileys on Water St. since the owners (?) were so very nice (Japanese, I believe since they accepted Yen too as payment).

Fun place to visit.,,We walked to Gastown this afternoon. This section of town reminded me of a town in the late 1800s. The street were brick and storefronts were old looking. There were many unique stores and restaurants.

Spend your time and money elsewhere,,"Spent 2 hours on Gastown visit - I wish that time was spent elsewhere... The streets were filthy, full of people who looked homeless and/or on drugs. It was hard to park, we ended up paying for parking on the 8th floor of a parking garage - to find out later that the elevator did not work (without any warning or explanation). Vancouver and it's surroundings has so many treasures that you cannot find anywhere else... We were amazed by Sea to Sky highway, Stawamus Chief, Shannon Falls, Seawall, Lynn Canyon Park - and I am sure we did not get a chance to see 10% of it in the 3 days we had. Do not waste your time on Gastown, especially if you live far from Vancouver and your visit is short.Take advantage of what's best in Vancouver - it's outdoor paradise. Yes, it is an enjoyable experience to visit a place that has old buildings, cobblestones, vintage lampposts, etc. - but chances are there is a town somewhere much closer to you where all these things exist and are cared for much better than in Gastown.","July 15, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:41:04.007384,2021-06-18 19:41:04.083569

Vancouver-June-2017,,We walked thru Vancouver and thus made out Way to the GASTOWN. The High Light of this Area to me was the STEAM CLOCK that RINGS on the HOUR.

Enjoy the walk and the diversity,,"Although my latest visit, in this case a walk-through, was in July 2017, I have visited Gastown a number of times since 2010.  Has it changed over the 10 years? Yes because one of my favourite venues - the underground history of Gastown theatrical production - has closed and no, because many of the same shops (some of them commercialized tourist traps) are still there.  The Steam Clock is still a major attention grabber, as well as the cobblestone and the variety of restaurants and pubs.  For me, the real joy of Gastown, is not so much the destination, but the journey.  I usually walk from various points on Main Street, carrying through to Chinatown, past some seedier areas, where by the way, I have never been bothered by panhandlers or otherwise, and then turning on to one of the back streets leading to Gastown.  Every block of the walk is like theatre; scenes and actors change every few steps.  Never a dull walk.   Once you arrive in Gastown, enjoy the diversity of shops.  Sit on the benches and watch as tour groups and individuals take in the mix of original, refurbished and new buildings.  A walk through Gastown is also an excellent way to get to Canada Place and Coal Harbour to watch the cruise ships, sailboats and seaplanes.  And, as long as you  have the money, you can eat (and drink) your way through the day.  I have rated Gastown and the environs a very good.  Very good because of its diversity and charm and its proximity to other areas of the city.  First-time visitors especially will fall in love.  I did not rate it as excellent because of the number of tourist trap type souvenir shops, which detract from the more authentic local and native art and crafts vendors. I would not describe it as a hidden gem either, because it is well advertized and quite easy to find, by foot and by transit.  Parking will be extremely difficult to find and I would not advise it.","July 7, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:42:28.335221,2021-06-18 19:42:28.413874

Main street has it all, Micro breweries, restaurants where the locals eat, lots of small independent shops and services.Bus service from Downtown is easy.Avoid Gastown like the plague.

Gassy Jack lives on,,"Gastown is Vancouver’s oldest neighborhood. The city started here with a single tavern founded by John ‘Gassy Jack’ Deighton in 1867. Apparently he was called gassy because he talked a lot not because he blew hot air from the other end. The former British sailor, river pilot and saloon keeper arrived with barrels of whiskey which made him a popular guy locally. There is a statue of him standing on a whiskey barrel in Maple Tree Square at Alexander and Powell Streets near the location of his first bar in Gastown.The area along Water Street with cobblestones and vintage lamp posts has had its ups and downs but today is lined with renovated old stone and brick buildings housing multiple souvenir shops, hi-end clothing boutiques, Inuit art outlets, galleries, restaurants and, of course, bars. There are walking tours for architecture and history buffs. A four-faced Steam Clock toots off the quarter hours and blows out a puff of steam on the hour at Cambie and Water Streets.

Nostalgic Evening Walk and Local shops,,"My friend and I decided to have a walk at Gastown that late rainy cold afternoon. What is more convenient than to hop on the Skytrain and get right to your destination as soon as you get off the station? Gastown can be nostalgic depends on the weather and time of day and that afternoon brought me back to the years I spent walking on a weekend in Florida, downtown Buenos Aires, Argentina. They had similar souvenir shops, same concept for tourists and locals alike, local shops where you can find unique pieces of clothing, shoes and artwork. My friend and I spent admiring Canadian artwork, photo frames at a small museum, trying on unique shoes at Fluevog and shopped at Latest Scoop. And just like most people, we waited and watched for the Steam Clock to whistle and steam and took pictures and videos, twice! For the half hour and the full hour... We even heard a group of young men after dinner screaming and running to witness this highlight of the place. You've never been to Gastown if you haven't witnessed this important event that happens every half hour!

Consider skipping the minors,,"Just like in my review of Vancouver, the Gastown district is a nice little quaint area of town with a few shops and many many pubs and restaurants.  Like much of Vancouver, Gastown is certainly best enjoyed without the minors as none of the pubs will permit them inside and only a few of the restaurants.  It is a bit of a hassle to search, particularly on a weekend.  Calling ahead and making reservations and to make sure minors are allowed would make for a much better Gastown visit.

Weird experience part I,,"Gastown itself was definitely worth the walk through. OK, it felt rather high-end and touristy, but the charm of the old city was definitely there. My kids, ages 10 and 12, were not so impressed, but I think my wife and I could have spent a lot longer here nosing around. The clock was pretty cool. It was a rainy day and the streets and shops were not crowded. We did not have any problem with solitications or observations of drug use ourselves, but this was at about 2pm. Lots of restaurants, lots of shops, and a very funky and laid-back atmosphere in my opinion. It got weird when we walked from Gastown to Chinatown. Within half a block of the main Gastown alleys, things degraded rapidly, and we stumbled upon a large collection of people who were clearly serious drug users. I am not sure if we wandered through a needle-exchange zone or what, but there were about 100 people from all walks of life concentrated on a small street corner and it was clear that these folks did not feel well. No violence, no threats, just a feeling of uneasiness. Caught this family of four (with 2 young kids) off guard. Would have appreciated some sort of ""warning"" I guess. Spent the next two hours explaining to my kids what we had just wandered through.","April 1, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:49:27.926014,2021-06-18 19:49:28.002360

Mainly for tourists,,"Gastown is a unique part of the city.  It has some historical buildings that have been upgraded and renovated in the western section.  It has rundown buildings and many poor people living in the eastern section, near Main St.  The western part has become home to film schools, university and art students, souvenir shops for the cruise ship passengers, and eclectic one-of-a-kind shops.  The eastern part has become gentrified amidst the population of poor and street people who are being pushed out.  Still, there are many services for the poor and homeless, so they are not going to be leaving anytime soon.  Gastown is steeped in history of the port and gold rush.  Enjoy the heritage architecture, try out an ethnic or unique restaurant and appreciate that the area is home to many kinds of residents.","March 13, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:50:07.481606,2021-06-18 19:50:07.558409

Best Downtown Neighborhood in the City,,"I have lived in Vancouver all my life and Gastown is my favorite neighborhood in the downtown core and one of the best in the entire city. It offers great boutique shopping, coffee galore, the best cluster of restaurants and bars. In the day, Gastown is a great place to grab coffee (Buro, Revolver, Timbertrain, Starbucks....JUST KIDDING) and walk through all the shops. Stay clear of the tourist shops, if you want any of those goods like maple syrup they can be purchased much cheaper elsewhere. This is the best boutique shopping in the city. Be sure to check out the steam clock, it makes for a great photo. At night Gastown is an awesome place to have a high quality meal with the best cluster of restaurants in the city (the Flying Pig, L'Abbatoir, the Alibi room, Water St. Cafe). Follow up this dinner with a drink at a many great bars including Portside, the Metropole, the Camie and the Alexander.

Among the best resteraunt in the area is an unpretentious little cafe named The Only Fish Shop. Lawyers and  homeless alike rub shoulders here to savor the delicious clam chowder served with healthy slices of crusty fresh sourdough bread. The cobbled streets are the original ones and such addresses as Blood Alley tell a tale of the early pre refrigeration custom of slaughtering aminals as close to the point of sale as possible.

"Eh, I'd give it a miss",,"As I mentioned in my Granville Island review, I used to live here.  I've not seen it as a tourist and a local.  As a local, there are some nice restaurants to check out but as a walking visit, I'd really just suggest you give it a miss.  There are only a few blocks of shops and they hit the polar ends of tourist paraphrenalia (which is why I went there) and high end design/furniture shops.... and oddly enough the spaghetti factory chain restaurant.  For those unfamiliar with Vancouver, Gastown is a dodgy part of town.  I would highly recommend you not go there at night unless you are with a local.  I would give anyone that even looks remotely dodgey a swerve without feeling 'bad' about it.  The real estate industry has been trying for YEARS to gentrify it and infuriatingly enough, priced in its VERY LONG potiential which was and is ridiculous.  I lived there for along time and it's been 4-5 years since I've been back to Gastown specifically, and it really hasn't changed.  IT's still got a gritty after taste that isn't a must see for tourists.  Just sayin.","February 10, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:51:17.724834,2021-06-18 19:51:17.804177

Cobble street historic district,,"This is one main street (Water St.) with about 2-3 cross-streets that have lots of historic charm. Many one-of-a-kind boutique stores -  clothing, shoe, designer furniture & eateries. Lots of tourist goods here. Brick streets, the very famous Steam Clock, street artists - especially native carvers. Some great pubs, interesting historic architecture. Unfortunately, there's almost nothing open until at least 10am -11am. I hate seeing cruise ship passengers wandering wasting their time until store openings. I really wish cruise ship staff would INFORM VISITORS of Gastown retail hours.(If your off a ship earlier AM & want to make the best use of your time,HEAD WEST for a spectacular walk along Vancouver's waterfront. There are a few breakfast and coffee place along the way. Head east back into Gastown around 10am. The side streets are well worth a look - Abbott St. Carrall St. - you can do a loop and check out some places on Cordova St. as well. Bloody Alley is cool - mostly because of the name - not a whole lot there. Definitely DO NOT go much more than a block east past Carrall St. It becomes a rougher neighbourhood. Not dangerous, so much as rundown. Visitors should all be cautious in Gastown re pick-pockets. Do not leave purses unattended on backs of chairs, etc. Not that much for kids or teens in Gastown. People LOVE the Steam Clock. It sounds with steam-driven whistles on the hour and I think, on the half hour in the summer.

So it's a cobbled street .......,,"Having read numerous previous reviews before I went, I found it a bit disappointing.  Several reviewers had enthused that it's just like Europe - seemingly because the ""main street"" is cobbled.  Well, yes it is, but Europe is more than just cobbled streets.  Europe usually also offers narrow passageways, lots of hanging baskets/window boxes filled with flowers and outdoor cafe.  Gastown has none of these - unless it's completely different in the summer than it is in January.  It has a high percentage of tourist/souvenir shops, so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the place to come.  Other reviews said Hudson House Trading Company is the best place for souvenirs, and although it's probably the largest, I didn't think it was necessarily the best.  There's another souvenir shop on the same side of the street as Hudson House, but further away from the Steam Clock.  Think it was called Smileys.  They had the same souvenirs but at better prices.  The most famous part of Gastown is of course the Steam Clock, which is on a corner just past Hudson House.  The steam is continuous but the clock only chimes on the hour.  There are the usual jewellery stores and art galleries, as well as a gazillion different cafes and bars.  Other reviews have mentioned that the area borders a bad section of the town and is becoming overrun with homeless, but I didn't really see that.  I was on my own, I felt perfectly safe and nobody bothered me.","January 15, 2017",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:51:57.785255,2021-06-18 19:51:57.874074

Great photo ops!  A vestige of the early days of Vancouver, it has evolved into a bit trendy spot to visit.Restaurants abound from casual to upscale. Shopping for local gifts and souvenirs  from Canadiana through genuine collectible First-nations art are all available within three blocks of pleasant walking.Don't forget the Hudson's Bay Company store, founded 1670, the oldest Department Store in North America. Just three blocks uphill from Gastown. Typical Department Store operation nowadays, but a few great ""old world"" tri-colour ribbon Hudson Bay Blankets, etc.All in all a good few hours and/or evening in Gastown is a great, short introduction to Vancouver.

A fun place to spend a few hours!,,"Gastown is named after Gassy, Jack Deighton, named  ""Gassy"" because he talked so much.  He built the first saloon in Vancouver.  It is now a mix of tourist shops, eclectic clothing and shoe store, coffee shops, funky restaurants, pubs and craft breweries and old brick buildings.  The steam clock is a must see!  It looks really old but was actually built in 1977.  It plays a little tune on each hour and blows steam out of the top.  It's fun to watch!There are so many little shops and restaurants located in a short stretch that you could spend a lot of time browsing.  It does border the Downtown Eastside, a neighbourhood know for its drug problems, so stay on the Main Street where all the shops are.A fun thing to do is take the Gastown food walking tour...find it on the internet and book it.  An informative guide will take you on a tour of Gastown, telling you stories of its history, and you stop at about nine locations for small bites and drinks.

Angles of old-style Van,,"A lot of people go to Gastown only for the Steam Clock and then they are disappointed because they expected it was bigger and more impressive. I suggest that if you have a couple of hours walk all Water Street, from Maple Tree Square to Waterfront Station: you'll discover some nice art galleries and shops and you'll really feel between the past and the present Van. Enjoy!","January 3, 2017",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:52:25.361198,2021-06-18 19:52:25.438431

"Avoid ""East East"" Hastings",,"True, you can find some trendy cafes and shops in this little area, but be forewarned that East Hastings turns into skid row quite quickly. We were there on Boxing Day and headed east from Waterfront Station. We thought we'd walk through Gastown to Chinatown, but we suddenly found ourselves in an area of terrible blight and misery. Almost every doorway was occupied by homeless people huddled under wet cardboard and plastic bags. The sidewalks were covered with garbage and litter, and graffiti scrawled on the walls identified one source of the devastation: ""Fentanyl eases the pain of gentrification,"" along with names of friends lost to addiction. Posters in several windows warned of the extremely high rate of overdose in the area. Though it was 1:00 in the afternoon and the streets were busy, a man injected himself not two feet from me on the sidewalk. Nobody hassled us, and we did not feel threatened, but it was quite a shock to see such suffering. After talking to several locals and reading up on the problem (The Globe and Mail featured the issue three days in a row while we were in town), it's clear that the city/province is taking opioid addiction and the resulting overdose crisis seriously. It's a relatively recent phenomenon, and the government is mobilizing to help those addicted. We just happened to wander cluelessly into ""opioid ground zero"" of all of North America, it seems. So this may not seem like a conventional review--parts of Gastown are probably what the guidebooks and other reviewers describe. However, I would suggest avoiding the Hastings route if you would rather not witness the sad scenes we observed. Or at least be prepared for what you might see just a couple of blocks from the Steam Clock.","January 2, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:52:25.517791,2021-06-18 19:52:25.595361

Pulls the Tourists In,,"Vancouver started in this neighborhood with the opening of John ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton's salon in 1867. The National Historic Site sprawls for a few blocks on the northeast end of Downtown, featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, tacky souvenirs, fine creations by indigenous people, boutiques and the list goes on. Skidrow with its homeless and drug dealers begins on its eastern edge, but I have noticed only a few homeless spilling over into the neighborhood itself.As a history buff, I like the well-maintained old brick buildings with information plaques about their past. Brick-paver sidewalks, antique-looking lampposts and cobblestone streets enhance the earlier-era ambiance. Maple Tree Square, mostly a busy intersection, is where Deighton built that salon and a statue of him stands there. His ""Gassy Jack"" nickname came from his penchant for talking a lot rather than a digestive problem. The square also holds historic Hotel Europe, now affordable housing for those with low incomes.This flatiron-type structure was the first reinforced-concrete building to go up in Vancouver. The popular steam clock at the corner of Cambie and Water streets, however, is not an authentic vintage timepiece. Instead, it was constructed and installed in 1977, commissioned by local Gastown businesses. It whistles on the quarter hour, generated by steam, but the clockworks themselves are operated by electric motors.Parking in Gastown can be expensive and I dislike driving its busy streets. Depending on location, I recommend walking here or taking public transportation. For example, SkyTrain's Waterfront station is extremely close.","November 24, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 19:53:30.162035,2021-06-18 19:53:30.246082

Vancouver History,,"We really enjoyed spending a few afternoons and evenings in Gastown. it’s one of the areas in Vancouver where you can see some history. Vancouver feels a bit like Miami in that it’s a new city that is ever expanding, very slick, modern buildings, young vibe, most of it less than 100 years old. Although rebuilt after several fires Gastown has an old feel to it, nice mixture of shops and restaurants. We were told that the Old Luna Cafe was where Greenpeace was founded, it’s been renamed but the old Luna Cafe sign still remains. The Gastown Clock and the 'Gassy Jack' statute are the more popular attractions to see but it’s a great place to eat out with some brilliant restaurants and bars like the Revel Room","November 5, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 19:54:23.678479,2021-06-18 19:54:23.755410

Worth a Walk...,,"Many modern cities have lost their link with the past, their origins and history* in the scramble to go highrise and expand.

A steamclock hisses loudly as we pass,  an immense arched window frames a massive Holland Line cruise ship berthed in the harbour, an angel bears aloft a soldier killed in one of our terrible world wars, four maidens in absurd, quirky, attractive apparel pose for a photograph, and a child’s T-shirt, emblazoned with Apple technology, declares ‘iPooed’.Gastown offers some very unique shopping experiences, particularly to collectors of vintage items and antiques... .  It's also a fun place to browse and explore.* Singapore’s Chinatown is a good example. We visited the original almost 40 years ago.

On a lovely mid-Saturday afternoon, I was asked for money by three people on the main streets of Gastown.  We saw 4 drug transactions, one person snorting what I assume was cocaine and one woman swinging a pipe yelling obscenities as we walked back and forth the two blocks between the main streets of Gastown and Chinatown.  I was surprised not to see any police presence in Gastown or Chinatown, in spite of the crowds and obvious common homelessness and open drug usage.

Worth a visit,,"We visited Gastown twice after spending our days in Steveston.  One day we were dropped off by a tai and the other day we walked down from the Skytrain Waterfront Station.  We were only on Water Street so I found the critiques of other streets interesting. I know my girlfriend did not feel comfortable veering off the beaten path. We enjoyed the atmosphere of Gastown. One night we ate outside at Chill Winston's and the next we ate (drank) in the upper floor of Six Acres, both near the Gassy Jack Statue.  One night we strolled back after the shops were closed and window shopped. Another night we shopped and strolled our way from the Skylink station and then ended up at Gassy Jack, again. The art galleries on the walk were worth seeing. We were too late for Fluevog or would have dropped in.  We enjoyed crepes from a French food truck proprietor.  The steam clock is fun and we saw it once as is and another night as part of a cycling race. The cycling competition created a unique environment with lots of energy on the street up against the barricades. We always felt safe on Water Street despite a few pan handlers.

"Pubs, antique shops native artefacts & steam clock",,Revisited this area of Vancouver during our recent stay & whilst the pubs restaurants and shops are all pretty much as I remember them from my previous visit I felt that the area has drifted into a neglected state with almost every corner taken up with homeless begging for money. I appreciate that Vancouver has a very tolerant approach to 'down & outs' but nonetheless found it quite threatening at times. The city also tolerates the general personal use of Marijuana & this might explain some of the more off the wall or in this case out of their head experiences I saw.

There's a mini Flatiron building here ( like the one in New York). See if you can find it. Be careful here though if you walk too far into the boarder of China town ( West Hastings meets East Hastings and Chinatown) you will come across streets that are full ( I mean very very full) of homeless. You will know when you get there. Probably avoid walking down East Hastings into Chinatown. Gastown is cool.

"Looks trendy, not so sure I'd spend much time there",,"Agree with dinki1960 review.  Wife (Chinese), 11 yr old daughter, and I made a day trip to Vancouver on a Friday, taking a BoltBus from Bellingham, WA.  Spent about 5 hrs walking from Pacific Central Station down Main St to Chinatown, then to Gastown.  Found many street people/homeless along our route, not super scary but there were some people we saw who had some problems, and the whole experience definitely detracted from the image I had of Vancouver.  Gastown was unique, many trees and flowers, pretty, except when we took a break from walking- stopped in a small parking lot overlooking the train yard and, farther out, the water.  We were sitting on parking curbs along a nice fence at the back of the lot along with other tourists, watching trains, when I noticed a used syringe in the grass under the fence about 2 feet from where my daughter was sitting.  During our whole time there (about 5 hrs late am to mid-afternoon) we were asked for money a number of times; one time a guy was simply sitting on the sidewalk outside the door of a small grocery in Chinatown and asked all who left for spare change.  I wish I had had more time to see other parts of the city... my lasting impression at this time is not great and I don't plan to go out of my way to return.  It did give me the opportunity to explain some things to my daughter about the effects of drug use, signs of it, how to deal with people asking for money, and how to avoid people who appear unstable or under the influence.","June 24, 2016",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 20:11:22.060122,2021-06-18 20:11:22.142341

It's upscale with John Fluevog headquarters and awesome store, and it's bohemian with an artsy handmade hat shop and various antique shops.

How did Gastown get its name?,,"Gastown was the original name of our town. Named after Fraser River Captain John ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton, because he was the first settler on the site that would later become Vancouver. He was called gassy because he loved to""gas"", which in Victorian times meant to talk a lot, telling tales of his adventures in his bar, The Globe Saloon. Gassy Jack came from New Westminster in a dugout canoe with his Indian wife. While officially the town was called Granville, named after the Earl of Granville, the British colonial secretary, the locals rejected that and chose to call it Gastown, even on Admiralty charts. The newly incorporated City of Vancouver, burned to the ground in the Great Fire of June 13, 1886.  Soon after moving into Deighton Hotel, 40 year old Jack lost his wife, and before she died, she arranged for him to marry her 12 year-old niece Qua-hail-ya or Madeline. The following year in 1871, she gave birth to a boy named Richard Mason after his uncle, Jack's late brother. Jack died at age 44 and left his estate to his three year-old son. Sadly the boy died six months after his father in November, 1875. Madeline lived to age 90, and died in 1948 on the North Vancouver Indian Reserve.","June 23, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 20:11:22.607972,2021-06-18 20:11:22.685423

Touristy but at least old buildings saved!,,"When I was growing up in Vancouver, Gastown was unknown, a place you didn't go.

Gastown is a fun stroll, lots to see, and enjoy the waterfront buildings/architecture of the past.

To add to the disappointment, we were led to believe that there was great shopping in the area.  There seemed to us to be two types of shops.  Furniture galleries (that had some very nice modern pieces), and souvenir shops filled with maple syrup, Mounted police T-Shirts and every other piece of inexpensive made to look Canadian, but made in China piece of tourist crap you might want.Being near the cruise ship terminal it clearly caters to those in town for a short time looking to pick up some trinkets.  We heard that the restaurants in the area were good, but we were not there at a meal time.At the very least, the City of Vancouver should take some pride and clean the area up.

Having bought from the first, we arranged a refund after some haggling.The other major problem, common across much of the city, is the number of unfortunate individuals begging and panhandling, some quite aggressively.  Not as many as in Chinatown (which is virtually a no-go area for tourists) but enough to cause unease and discomfort.I certainly would not want to be here after dark","May 1, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:15:41.031036,2021-06-18 20:15:41.108192

Gastown--worth discovering.,,"Gastown is worth visiting, if you have not done so already.  It attracts a mixture of locals as well as tourists, but it is mainly oriented to the tourism industry.While Water St. (and area) have bona fide historic flavour, it's worth noting that the look of the place is largely cosmetic--a sanitized version of the old Granville Townsite.The real Granville was a bit more gritty, and for those who are historically inclined, you will quickly detect the 19-tens warehouse buildings under an earlier period decorative ""icing.""Somehow, it all works, and the historic vibe, while not all authentic, is rather fun.  One feature in Gastown that you might want to check out is the Old Spaghetti Factory, at #53 Water St..  The food is nothing spectacular, but the price is not too far out of line for what you get. Inside, you will find the only Vancouver streetcar to have survived intact.  It's the real thing, it was built locally, and it's even reputed to be haunted.  How good is that?  Best of all, you can sit an eat inside of it.There are also a number of great cafes, bars and restaurants to discover, and each of these has a unique flavour to offer.Allow an hour or two for a quick visit, or stop by multiple times if you are passing through Vancouver's downtown.  Gastown is only a block away from Waterfront Station, where you can catch the Canada Line, the SkyTrain, the Westcoast Express, and the SeaBus.  Plenty of signage, so you won't get lost.","March 23, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:16:58.286946,2021-06-18 20:16:58.364522

"Great and touristy, get your typical souvenirs here",,"We visited Gastown on a recent trip to Vancouver. I wasn't sure about it b/c I had read several reviews on here that said it was super touristy and to skip it. I'm glad we didn't. While it is very tourist inclined, the Steam Clock is fun to see and it's an easy walk up and down the street to take in a historic part of Vancouver. We also found a great restaurant (Water Street Café) while we were walking around. We needed some typical souvenirs for family and friends (t-shirts, magnets, and the like) and we did find them here. But, some of the stores also had local items and artwork which was fun to see. It doesn't take long to walk through and see everything if you aren't souvenir shopping, but I'd still take the time to do it. The Steam Clock is pretty neat and a landmark worth visiting. While you're there, walk across the street and have the grilled chicken club and fries at the Water Street Café. If you like bacon and brie, you won't be disappointed.  I had read in several reviews that there are lots of homeless people asking for money which we did experience (We actually got cursed out by a homeless woman, but just chalked that up to part of the experience being downtown). In that respect, Gastown was no different then being in our own downtown. :) I'd recommend Gastown for an easy walk through a historic part of Vancouver.

Vancouver's #2 Tourist Zone,,"Gas Town is named after a local drunk and saloon owner nicknamed ""Gassy"" Jack for his flatulent nature, and it was the scummy end of the city until they cleaned it up 25-30 years ago. Water St. is the main thoroughfare lined with bars, restaurants, souvenir shops and many stores, some quite funky and some quite pricey. It's right downtown and it's considered one of the entertainment districts, Downtown Vancouver has 4 of these. Gastown runs parallel to Cordova street from 1 block East of the SeaBus/Skytrain Station and down towards Carrall St. where there is a round, cobblestoned plaza and more drinking establishments to the South. Beyond that you enter the lower bowels of this city, full of druggies, hookers, weirdos and petty thieves all the way to Main St. (and beyond) at the North end of Chinatown. Surprisingly, it's quite safe and the sights are quite shocking at times. Check out the Steam Clock, dine on expensive, day-old pasta at the Old Spaghetti Factory, have a drink at the Blarney Stone Irish Pub and don't forget the camera.","December 4, 2015",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:19:56.738370,2021-06-18 20:19:56.815211

A trendy self-conratulatory district with a few highlights,,"Gastown sounds cools and has a cool history and the steam clock is delightful and it's on the edge of homelessness and shopping carts and full of the chest-heave of gentrification as redemption, etc. blahblahblah and while it is a pleasant way and place to shop and wander for a while, it's website claim to be ""the epicenter of independent deisgn, culture, food and fashion"" strikes me as both grandiose and silly. Like in most tourist districts the too-many souvenir shops all have essentially the same stuff and the only advantage of visiting more than one is to possibly save a few bucks on the same merchandise. Nonetheless, there are some nice fine art galleries and public houses and coffee shops, so if you enjoy a leisurely stroll through a part of town that is more focused on being a shopping district than a historic district, which is to say if you enjoy shopping in an area that isn't a cookie-cuttered mall, you'll enjoy Gastown.

Not What We Expected,,"Cab driver who picked us up from the airport recommended Gastown so we gave it a go. It is basically one street of shops, many of them overpriced, and a clock.

One street in particular was the trading centre for all the homeless, drug addicts and alcoholics. It looked like a dump. Police were there arresting one man, while all the underworld goings on continued around them. It was scary stuff. The few shops and eateries in the main street did not make up for it.

A night out on the tiles with the boys in Gastown,,"I had a surprise visit from number one son who is a captain pilot with a private airline from overseas. He and his crew had a few days off before returning. He suggested a visit to Gastown, as his crew and never been there and I had been there a couple of years ago. So off we went and parked the car rental in nearby parking,I am partially disabled and we used my special parking pass and got a space very close  to two well known pubs we were to visit. We choose ""Steam Works"" for a late afternoon snack lunch which was very substantial,great service,good pub food and well filled . The main eating area was at a lower level than the sidewalk and I had to enter carefully as the steps were everywhere with handrails,but was enjoyable.My son's crew wanted to see the Blue Jays baseball final game on Sports TV. So off we walked past the famous Steam Clock on the sidewalk taking pictures like every tourist does,many tourists were there at the same time as us. After about one block walk we reached a another well known pub,'The Lamplighter' also a restaurant and bar,but with a great sports TV area with many TV sets at different heights and sizes,We managed get to a good seat,using me as a pawn to get a good spot. The boys saw the baseball game and  had a few drinks and enjoyed the atmosphere which was electric.It should be noted that the Gastown area has many good restaurants,pubs,bars,cafes,tourist type shops and just a fun area to walk through. We finished our visit and on leaving  I did not notice the change in level using badly lit steps and fell into the arms of a guy and his gal to end our evening in a blaze of glory.

Loved it.,,"After spending a couple of hours in Stanley Park, we then walked back to the area of Gastown.  We saw the steam clock and walked along the main streets to see the wonderful shops and original commercial buildings.  We stopped often to read the historic descriptions of the buildings and were very impressed at the way Gastown has been restored to reflect how the old city of Vancouver must have looked as it was growing into a major port city.  Although many of the stores were designed to attract tourists, there were a number of very unique stores selling unique items.  Unable to buy anything because of luggage and weight restrictions, I nonetheless loved walking through this area.  One could spend a great deal of time just browsing in the antique stores.

Gassy Jack Steam Clock,,"As Seattle’s Pioneer Park is the site of the original settlement, Gastown is Vancouver’s place of origin, named for John “Gassy Jack” Deighton (1830–1875). Born in Hull, England, Deighton worked a California gold mine, until 1858. Unsuccessful in the Canadian gold rush, he opened the popular Globe Saloon (and other subsequent bars), and earned the nickname Gassy Jack, thus Gastown became known are the area around Gassy’s bar. Established in the Victorian era, electric streetlights now resemble the multi-globe lamps operated by…um, gas. Even the iconic Steam Clock that whistles every 15 minutes is operated by gas.In 1886 the Great Vancouver Fire destroyed all but two buildings, but the newly incorporated city of Vancouver rebuilt. Predictably, as with all original settlements, the area known as Gastown devolved into a seedy area. A restoration and regentrification period began in the 1960s, preserving much of the Victorian flavor of Gastown. All that said, this area is an excellent daylong adventure.

Lots of original buildings are now being utilized. A great place to wander in and around. All the streets are user friendly and if you notice a little of Vancouver's dark side residents and you shouldn't be alarmed, they have been around since day one. Considered by the local residents as being atmosphere. Lots of hidden gems when you walk the old alleys and don't forget to look up at the roof tops. The Roger's Sugar building, the first jail in the mews. Once there was a thriving community that lived below the streets. Can be read about on Google. The steam clock, the polished floors of the Sinclair building and the Sea bus and Rail Station Architecture. Good foot wear and be ready for boat loads of tourists.

We previously visited there about 20 years ago and it's really great to see that it has been revitalized since then. The steam clock is unique and a tourist draw.

"A very intersesting district of the city full of good restaurants, coffee shops and uh... junkies.",,"This part of Vancouver has many attractions and I think it's a very interesting place but I'd suggest not spending too much time here even though it's a good place for food and coffee. There are a lot of great restaurants here that have sprung up, but also there are a lot of people with drug problems that frequent the area, so I'd suggest you be prepared for that reality if you go here. They're not aggressive or dangerous. If you make eye contact with them they often look away and leave the area quickly. It's actually quite sad, but there is little you can do for them and if they ask for spare change you can decide to give it or not. I usually do if I have some. Overall I think it's an interesting part of the city and worth seeing, but don't stay too long, it's not really dangerous, more depressing after a prolonged visit.

There is really just one street to walk, Water street I think, but it's a good way to spend a few hours.

Worth a visit,,"Gastown can be a fun place to visit.  It includes the oldest buildings in the city, charming cobble stone streets, some interesting shops and decent restaurants.  The atmosphere is relaxed, and if you are visiting Vancouver, it is well worth a visit....especially on a sunny afternoon.For visitors, there are a few suggestions I would keep in mind:First, if you are staying at a downtown hotel, and enjoy walking, walk to the area.  Walk to the north end of Granville or Howe Street, head east on Cordova, and when you get to Richards St, veer left onto Water Street.Second, try to visit on a sunny day.  Things tend to be more lively when the weather is nice,Third, unless you are with someone who knows the area, avoid going too far east of Carrall Street.  The east end of Gastown backs onto one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Canada.  Without going into details, I will just say that the change can be disconcerting to the visitor.","August 10, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:26:05.179617,2021-06-18 20:26:05.259179

Neat Spot,,"I read a lot of negative stuff about Gastown but walked down anyway. I'm glad I did. It was a neat spot. Neat shops and pretty good dining. Definitely worth seeing.

Between Chinatown and Gastown there are a ton of bums, hookers and drug addicts. They shoot up on the street right in front of you. Not something you generally want the kids to see. If you don't have kid's and you're from a small town like me you may want to take the walk.

Fabulous first night out with high quality bicycle racing.,,"This place is right next to the harbour so you can see cruise ships and seaplanes and the west coast railway. Also loads of touristic shops. A wonderful feature is a steam driven clock that gives off small puffs of steam just running the 4 sided clock. A bit like a miniiature of big ben. The fun moments are when the ""chimes"" happen. I don,t want to spoil the surprise. Anyway I have never been to a proper bike race before but this one was really exciting. Vancouver streets are mostly a srictly a grid pattern but near the harbour their are good curves and even a hairpin bend. The first race was for women and then the mens. Laps were taking under 2 minutes and the speed rush was extrordinary. They has tessla electric cars leading and tailing the cyclists for safety. The streets were cordened off but lots of well drilled race marshalls were there to keep riders and audience safe and allow us to crosx the track and move round the circuit.

Don't Go Here!,,"So, if you use paper travel guides, here's my lesson to you: Always take what they say with a grain of salt, especially if written by a single author. Such was our case and the reason I'm writing this review thus. Someone mentioned that their guidebook suggested visiting Gastown, saying that it was a colorful and vibrant place for people-watching and culture, or something like that. Well, it could not have been more wrong. Granted, we were here on the night of the Caucks-Bruins Stanley Cup final, but it was obvious this is the part of Vancouver that Canada doesn't want you to see. The rest of the city was nice, very clean and welcoming as a rule. Gastown was everything else. Dirty, disgusting, unwelcoming, and creepy. While the rest of Vancouver's residents were busy enjoying the game at the arena or in a bar, the residents of Gastown were smoking, doing drugs, soliciting Johns, or wandering around aimlessly without their teeth while they shouted meaningless babble. Needless to say, we got out as soon as we could, practically running to our ferry out of town before the riots started. (Yes, there were riots after the game that night.) My advice to you: Unless you want to test out your new martial arts skills or give a witness statement to the police, DON'T GO HERE. I hope I've made myself clear. And if you see something different in a travel guide, send a friendly letter to the publisher to check their facts. Note: TripAdvisor only lets you write reviews within the last year, but my family and I actually visited in Summer 2009.","June 16, 2015",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 20:28:01.864266,2021-06-18 20:28:01.944455

A little foodie gem,,"Gastown is a very small historic area with lots of souvenir and ""art"" shops that make it a tourist trap and sorry to say the steam clock is boring.

For pizza head over to Nicli Antica Pizzeria, for pub food there is The Greedy Pig, Wildebeest (a few blocks away) , and Alibi Room to name a few. For great food go to L'Abattoir, Secret Location, and Blacktail Restaurant. For something different try Salt Testing Room and Meat & Bread.  Now, don't go past Columbia Street going East.

"Go for a meal, but arrive early enough to see the shops!",,"I had to hustle down to Gastown as the sun set behind me. Many of the museum and art shops close at a certain time, and it's really half the fun of being there. I picked up many of my smaller gifts and souvenirs for friends at those novelty shops you find everywhere. Yet, being an arts district, you can find many galleries with native art and pieces if you've got the money and the appreciation for these things. This is probably the dividing point for people who visit this area. It is definitely worth a look, especially if you can find cultural pieces, even just to see.The other half of Gastown, at least for me, was the eating. Honestly, I had to eat two full meals in two hours just to make sure I experienced the area properly. There were three places on my list-- The Flying Pig, The Irish Heather, and Guu. Now, as a solo traveler, there were many places which felt like I should come with my lover, or with friends to enjoy a talk and share some good food. I want to say, I leaned towards to two places where I'd feel secure sitting alone, enjoying a meal and a drink, so I went to the latter two. But that's just me!So come here for some higher priced, yet unique cultural pieces, and/or come here for the food. It's definitely an experience and a feeling a bit different than the wild streets just a few blocks away. Definitely a 'have-to' for anyone who wants more than just big brand shopping and fast-food all the way.","May 17, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 20:28:36.067738,2021-06-18 20:28:36.174434

It's the oldest area of Vancouver, so it has many historic buildings reflecting the Victorian era.  In fact it's a historically certified neighborhood.

Being from Australia I thought this was great as it's really hard to find most of these brands in Aus. It's still fun to look though. My top suggestions would be:- the steam clock- the Steamworks brewery - The Flying pig for drinks and snacks-Kit and Ace for great basics at a slightly more affordable price. We don't have this store in Aus and it is a chain, but I loved it. It's meant to be opening in Sydney later this year.","April 11, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 20:28:47.149854,2021-06-18 20:28:47.256315

The cobblestone streets and antique lamp posts give the area a quirky feel. Starting at the statue of Gassy Jack we wandered up the streets towards the famous steam clock.

A MUST,,"Gastown has some great looking buildings, lots of history, tons of great suvenier shops, and the famous steam clock.

There is a famous Steam Clock on the Water Street, but unfortunately, the clock was not there due to the maintenance. This is the only disappointment in visiting here. I simply enjoyed seeing nice buildings while walking. Probably more shops/restaurants would be open at later hour, around evening time. One thing I noticed while walking was the area above the Gassy Jack statue seemed a bit dodgy even at day time. Therefore, I assume it would be better not to walk around the area at late hours, especially if you are a solo traveler or with small children.

Only a short stroll,,"Vancouver is an odd city. Surrounded by beautiful scenery, the city itself seems a soulless place. Most of the original, and no doubt more interesting, buildings have been torn down and replaced with steel and glass towers, giving the place a sleek, modern yet empty feeling, devoid of heart. Gastown is the balm to that irritant. Only a short stroll from the towers you find yourself in a neighbourhood with buildings on a human scale and interesting shops, bars and restaurants in abundance. Sure, the steam clock brings the usual tacky souvenir shops in its wake, but once past there things improve.

"Nice place to stroll, browse, and grab a coffee",,"When the weather is nice, Gastown, with its lovely cobblestone streets, is a picturesque place to stroll around, browse some trendy shops (sure, there's some that are touristy and some over-priced, but there are also decent boutiques!), and enjoy a coffee from one of the many cafes around (I quite enjoy Milano). Tip: The parking rates are much more reasonable just at the edge, for example on Powell, just east of Columbia, but keep in mind not to wander too far east (the neighbourhood starts to get sketchier past a certain point just past Columbia, closer to Main).","September 8, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:30:40.586816,2021-06-18 20:30:40.662756

Gastown Vancouver,,"I have looked through Gastown from the eyes of a tourist and the eyes of a resident.

Just one block away however, you will see a part of the city which is a bit disturbing  (it was to me anyways). There are many homeless people just sitting and lying around, smoking, eating and conversing. It certainly puts things in perspective.Overall a good experience, but nothing really extraordinary.","August 7, 2014",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:31:50.614483,2021-06-18 20:31:50.708057

Old town vibe,,"My family visited this place as we didn't have anywhere else to go that day, we actually went to Chinatown but since the map says Gastown was just nearby we gave it a go.

Its drizzling a bit so the effect is like Sherlocky Holmes :) yes the reviews are true, there were a lot of homeless peeps over ther, they meant no harm, some looked like they were hign on some stuffs as they were dancing, prancing, rapping in the streets but they just do their stuffs without disturbing us, we saw a van with foods and they were distributing it to some of the folks. its quite safe, there's a lot of nice looking old England style restos and shops too.","January 13, 2014",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:34:11.993860,2021-06-18 20:34:12.074876

An unusual clock in a lively area,,"Gastown is a busy and lively area of Vancouver.  The street the clock is in, is full of tourist shops and cafes.  There are not many tourist shops elsewhere in the town.  The clock itself is very pretty and chimes every quarter hour with the full Westminster chimes every half hour and has  steam coming out of the top continuously. Crowds gather when it is time to chime and take photographs.  A few yards away is the statue of Gassy Jack - a larger than life statue at the confluence of several roads.  Beyond that is Hastings St. - not recommended because of the panhandlers.  Having seen and photographed the clock, it was lunchtime and we decided to visitthe Silvestre café nearby.  This is a small Peruvian café with some lovely dishes on offer as well as delicious cakes and ice-cream.  Whilst having our meal, we could hear the steam clock chime from inside the restaurant and see the Open Bus stops outside the café for their terminus. Canada Place is only a short walk away so it is quite central.You won't find a steam clock elsewhere so do visit it.  Very close is the Look Out Tower as well and a new Food Court is shortly to open there.

Get down to Gastown,,"THE steam clock in Gastown has to be one of the iconic images of Vancouver.Certainly the locals know this because one battered man who had clearly fallen on hard times used the clock to make his begging pitch.It was coming up to 4pm and ourselves and nearly 50 others spectators were treated to a running countdown commentary by this man who exhorted everyone to pay attention and focus on the clock while loudly reassuring us that he wouldn't let us miss the key moment.That was duly announced by loud plumes of steam followed by encouragement from the man to ""take yer pictures"" before he went round with his hat to collect coins for his ""help"".But it is not just the clock which makes Gastown well worth a visit.It has character, atmosphere, a great range of eateries -- I particularly recommend the Old Spaghetti factory -- and a varied range of tourist and other shops.It is also the starting point for the hugely popular Big Bus tours which are such a useful method for seeing this part of the city.There are also various bars which are a story in their own right as Gastown is named after ""Gassy"" Jack Deighton, a Yorkshire seaman, steamboat captain and bartender who arrived in 1867 to open the area's first saloon. He used the simple expedient of saying he and his family had nowhere to live while encouraging those listening to build him a place.....in return for a chance to sample the barrel of whisky he had!

The steam clock is a cool piece of history, and the restaurants in the area where great for what we were looking for! Easy walk to markets, check out Lou's Butchers and if you like a decent walk you can walk over to Robson street for shopping or Granville island! This little area has its kinda bad area around Hastings street but everywhere has a bad area, you just gotta use your common sense huh :) The best part is the main area where the Steam Clock is, and Id recommend it at night!

"Gastown, Vancouver's oldest & coolest neighbourhood",,"Ignore the steam clock -- it's boring, except when it sounds the hour and half-hour. Instead, explore some of the coolest clothing shops and restaurants in town. Maple Tree Square is the heart of Gastown and is where Vancouver began. The Europe Hotel anchors the square and is an iconic flatiron building where four streets converge -- Water, Powell, Alexander and Carrall. Each street has its own attractions. On Carrall, there's the Irish Heather pub and Salty Tongue deli, the Blarney Stone for a beer and a bite to eat, and across the street are the Cork & Fin restaurant for seafood and L'Abbotoir for cocktails and fine dining (it's pricey but worth it). Down Powell, just steps from the square are four great restaurants: the Sitar (Indian food), Lily Mae's (comfort food with a French twist), the Sardine Can (a tiny tapas bar) and Rodney's (oysters and a large selection of seafood).Across the street on the corner of Water is Chill Winstons, a cool place to chill out on its sunny deck), Peckinpah's on the corner serves north Carolina BBQ, and Six Acres offer dozens of import beers, which you can sample on their deck.And don't forget to check out Fluevog's shoe store on Water Street, La Differencia shoe store and the Inform Interiors store.At the top of Water street there is also the local brewpub, Steamworks, for casual dining on the deck or inside with a view if it's raining.","August 12, 2013",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:35:07.502807,2021-06-18 20:35:07.579678

The only thing to see in Gastown is the Steam Clock.  I walked all that way to take a picture of a steam clock?  Plus, the WORST NEIGHBORHOOD IN ALL DEVELOPED COUNTRIES is right next to it.  We, unknowingly, ended up on Hastings Street trying to get from Gastown to Chinatown.  There were hundreds of homeless people in the streets with used condoms and used needles scattered in the streets.  I am serious--google ""vancouver downtown eastside"" and see what pops up.

Steam clocks and Canada Kitsch,,"I haven't been to Gastown for a long time, but really liked taking a stroll through this time. We arrived to see a huge crowd of people, cameras ready for the steam clock to go off. It was cool, although expected.

Lots of food and little shops in Old Town setting,,"We spent the day walking around Gastown and checking out the little shops and restaurants that dot the street. A must see is the steam powered clock standing at the corner. It's beautiful. Every half hour it chimes and releases steam, so try to make your way over there to listen to it. After looking through many restaurant menus, we decided (against our out of town rule that we never eat at a chain restaurant) that with the kids in tow, we would eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory, rather than take them into a pub or make them try something new that included bone marrow- none of them seemed to like that idea. Gastown itself was charming and exactly what we expected. Be warned, there are many panhandlers. The later it got, the more they seemed to come out. A few of them were very persistent. I'd say Gastown is best for people who can enjoy the pubs and the European atmosphere.","August 5, 2013",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:35:07.736579,2021-06-18 20:35:07.812694
Not Dangerous but Not Exciting,,I'm a bit confused as to why Gastown seems to be such a big tourist attraction to be honest. There is a couple of expensive boutique shops and a Steam clock which apparently featured on the front of Nicklebacks Album and that is it really. I lived here for 6 months and although the people walking around are probably some of the craziest people you'll ever wander by (hearing a random woman swearing at a post box is not an unusual site) I never had any trouble at all and that is walking alone at all parts of the day (from 1pm in the afternoon to 4am in the morning).Nice restaurants though so I guess that is a good thing about it but there is nice restaurants all over the city.,"July 28, 2013",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:35:07.812699,2021-06-18 20:35:07.888526
Midday strolls to see some points of interest but understand the wary concerns...,,"Having missed Gastown on my visit nearly 40 yrs ago, it was one of the things I wanted to see this time.  I knew the reputation as a bit loose, a bit edgy but also having the less attractive face of life in a big city.  Happily we did not really see any of this on our two visits to the area, apart from an inebriated individual shuffling along the street.The first, a Friday lunchtime, we walked down Water Street from the Skytrain terminus past the Steam Clock to Gassy Jack's and the Hotel Europe (the flatiron)and back - quite a few arty tourist shops. The second time on the Sunday 2 days later we walked through from Science World via Chinatown to have a look at the old Woodwinds site and had a bit of sandwich lunch at Cambie General Store & Bakery ( did I see someone say it had closed? we were there only a couple of weeks ago) which was really good.It was interesting to see this area and I am glad we saw nothing seedy.  Fortunate, maybe.There is redevelopment going on and perhaps it does need policing a bit better to clean up the more undesirable elements.  Some dislike ""gentrification"" but there has to be a focus for inward investment with civic effort to make a more attractive environment that people do want to see and live in.  Glad to have finally been to Gastown and hope it does get better.","July 26, 2013",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:35:07.888532,2021-06-18 20:35:07.963686
First and last visit.,,"We missed Gastown on our last visit to Vancouver and decided to visit this time. Once was enough for me. It's run down, tacky, busy, and watch out for the addicts either hustling for a couple of dollars to buy food or walking through the pavement cafes while the waiting staff are elsewhere. Only the steam clock made the visit worthwhile for me.

The Gastown steam clock is the only attraction, and it's not that impressive.  I recommend skipping this an finding a locals neighborhood to hang out.  You'll have a much better experience.

Wow, shocking....yes I saw the clock in Gastown, other than that I saw people unconscious on the sidewalks, rolled up in blankets, prostitutes, several drug deals going on while we  were heading to Chinatown, people so messed up on drugs they could barely walk.  It was disturbing.  I had two of my children with me and we came back to our downtown hotel and just kind of looked at each other, like what the heck was that all about, once again Sunday morning 10 a.m.  Not sure why these two places are on the 10 things to do in Vancouver.

There are some good tourist shops and lots of eating places but it certainly isn't the highlight of a trip to Vancouver.

Depressing....needs a facelift!,,"Gastown is not what it once was. It use to be a unique destination, a fun place to take visitors to and walk around. As a teenager I would enjoy biking through the street to get to work. I have seen Gastown go through many phases.  Sadly, various business come and go: Storyeum: History of BC preformed with actors, numerous restaurants, and stores. Originally, the area was the birthplace of Vancouver in Confederation year 1867, by John 'Gassy Jack' Deighton, now a National Historic site. It seems to be still popular with tourist, but I can't imagine many locals going there. It looks very tired. The Cobblestone Road needs much work....why are repairs made with black top and not with original stone? It use to have really good art stores, and modern furniture stores; now here seems to be a lot of souvenir stores.  As for the clock people write about...it looks good BUT it is faux-Heritage steam clock.(it is fake!) It is less than 40 years old, partially run by steam, it has three electric motors inside. One runs a fan that blows the steam out the top. Another that controls the valves that plays the tunes on the five 'steam' whistles on the top of the clock. It was built over a steam grate to prevent the homeless from sleeping on the spot on cold nights. There is still an eclectic group of people there, they may add character to the street but is this what you want to see? Give Gastown a miss, go visit one of the many great parks in the Vancouver area: Stanley Park, English Bay, or even Ambleside Park. I will keep driving through the area until I have a good reason to shop or visit there.","June 28, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 20:35:20.036864,2021-06-18 20:35:20.117852

"beautiful archtecture, but pretty seedy area",,"Gastown is a historic part of Vancouver. This is where Gassy Jack Dalton opened a bar and the city of Vancouver was born. Lots of beautiful architecture, and who can forget the Steam Clock. Lots of pricey shops and restaurants.  It’s also close to the cruise terminal, so it gets pretty busy when there is a ship docked.  There are buskers and street entertainers; you can even get a caricature done. That’s the nice part of Gastown and it lasts for about 3 blocks.   The rest of Gastown is a haven for the down-and-out, so be prepared for a look at the seedy  underside of Vancouver if you wander too far into the Gastown district. You can expect to be accosted by drug dealers, even in daylight, and the ever present homeless looking for handouts. I prefer to give my donations to agencies who help the homeless, so it was somewhat uncomfortable. They mostly stick to the shadows in the daylight, but it gets pretty rough after dark. I never felt unsafe, but we were there in daylight and my husband casts a rather large shadow. There is a sign for public washrooms.  DON’T GO THERE! It is one of those self-cleaning washrooms in a square filled with junkies and alcoholics.

Gastown: Where Trendy Works,,"I just loved our morning and night walks in Gastown. It's such a beautiful little area in Vancouver that still retains its historic charm and independent spirit. I couldn't quite decide if Gastown is more about urban upscale or simple Canadian warmth as we experienced plenty of both. Anyway, the restaurants there offered us amazing food experiences with charming attitude and jazz. The center piece of the district amongst all these restaurants and quirky shops is The Steam Clock.

If this is history ...........,,"In Vancouver for a couple of days at the end of a cross-country trip across Canada with my family - me, my wife and two teenage boys and as we are staying at the Pan Pacific Hotel we visited Gastown as it is effectively right on our doorstep. Having read quite a lot of reviews on this area from Tripadvisor reviewers we were expecting something a bit historic and unique in this fairly modern city, but what you get is a steam clock, a few older looking buildings, a poor selection of shops and some fairly average looking restaurants. For me it also lacked any atmosphere and there are a couple of parts which look a bit dodgy to me overall.

"Gastown's great for bar-hopping & dining, but there are better places for general sightseeing",,"Gastown is more interesting as a cocktail/pub-hopping and dining destination than a daytime sightseeing destination, in my opinion. The atmosphere is definitely vintage for Vancouver, keeping in mind that Vancouver was founded in 1886 and most of its original buildings no longer exist, with exception to most of the buildings in Gastown and Chinatown. There are certainly some interesting small-scale boutiques mixed in with the touristy souvenir shops, as well as the occasional high end modern home decor shop (and some artsy/hipster coffee shops).  But the restaurant lounges/cocktail bars/pubs are the most interesting, although most start to open by 5-5:30pm. The most charming part of Gastown (for tourists) is Water Street. It takes all of 10 minutes to walk its length. The famed Steamclock was built in 1977 as a tourist attraction and despite its appearance, no longer runs on steam but electricity. The real history here is in the architecture.Once you start exploring the side streets, you may unintentionally do what many visitors do - stumble upon the infamous Downtown Eastside, a community stricken by poverty, mental illness, homelessness, and drug addiction. It's not violent nor are you unsafe, although you may feel uncomfortable. Be prepared for people asking for spare change on Water Street.My favourite places to eat/drink in Gastown:The Diamond (for cocktails, romantic atmosphere)The Alibi Room (for fabulous craft beer selection/casual dining)Pourhouse (for cocktails, cozy atmosphere)Guilt & Co (hipster pub/live music in a cellar-like atmosphere)Nelson The Seagull (funky hip coffee shop with excellent baked goods)Nicli Antica Pizzeria (for authentic Neapolitan pizza)The Irish Heather (for Irish pub food, Irish/English beer and Scotch)Chill Winston (for a glass of wine/cocktails)L'Abattoir (for craft cocktails/gourmet)Peckinpah (for bourbon)Calabash (for Caribbean food/rum)Six Acres (for Belgian beer/cozy atmosphere)Cork & Fin (for quality casual dining/seafood)Salt Tasting Room (for wine/charcuterie)The Revel Room (for cocktails/casual food)Jules Bistro (for classy French bistro food)Kitanoya Guu with Otokomae (for Japanese izakaya/tapas-style dining)I'm probably forgetting a few, but this will give you a good start!","November 27, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:36:39.513939,2021-06-18 20:36:39.590063

However travelers and visitors looking for Vancouver's history, architecture, and/or natural beauty will be highly disappointed. Gastown, in addition to Granville Island, Chinatown and North Vancouver Esplande shopping differ in location and presentation, but essentially the store contents are similar. Vancouver is a city of local art and fresh foods; therefore, all four areas feature an assortment of stores selling Canadian handmade jewelry/clothing and fresh foods from around the world. Store front after store front after store front. They start to blend together. With the option of whale watching, suspension bridges over canyons/falls or sunny beaches, I would only shop these 3-4 block pocket areas when I need to fill an hour or two in my day.

"Gastown, Vancouver, BC",,"Having arrived in Vancouver early for a Celebrity Century cruise I decided to spend a half day seeing what I could of Vancouver. Gastown is a short 10 minute walk from the cruise docking site at the Olympic flags area. Turn left as you exit the ship and walk along safe streets to Gastown. Gastown is really only about two blocks wide and is the oldest remaining section of town. The older buildings some Victorian give it a quaint feel. Gas Jack the steam driven clock which chimes the Westminster chimes every 15 minutes adds to the ambience. Some 1rst Nation culture can be seen, as well as, native art galleries and shops. If you want to buy souvenirs there some inexpensive shops with a wide variety of goods in Gastown. Upscale to casual dining is plentiful. The Old Spaghetti Factory is a favorite to some. From Gastown it is a short walk to Chinatown but you need to walk through a pretty rough section with homeless and vagrants all about. If you want to go to chinatown the better solution is take the translink from the waterfront area.

Also, Gastown is the city side of the seabus connection to the North Shore which in turn leads to all sorts of great places to explore, starting with Lonsdale Quay.

The Gas Clock is neat to see and here, and it's pretty scenic so if you like snapping photos, you'll have some good material to work with.We went once for just a stroll through the area, and then we went back again to have dinner one night and found it very enjoyable both time.Take Translink to Waterfront station and it's within easy walking distance.","August 2, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:38:15.334593,2021-06-18 20:38:15.409860

cobblestone streets?,,"Brick, actually, not cobblestone. Shops are pretty boring, needs more than the usual tourist carvings, posters and t-shirts. This street is a hollow reminder of what it was in the 70's, when it actually had remains of some cobblestone, a thriving old department store or two, several head shops,artist's studios, a big metal sculpting workshop (Harmon Foundry), Indian import shops, corner stores and diner cafes. Way too squeaky clean these days. One bright spot is the SFU expansion into the area, at least they have commemorated the place with a large black and white mural in their atrium  of the GrassTown Smoke-in, circa 1970 ish, when RCMP made headlines bashing harmless teenybopper heads in with billysticks.","July 29, 2012",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:38:27.823426,2021-06-18 20:38:27.905204
"Not really much here, but loved the steam clock",,"Gastown is the oldest part of Vancouver, but that only makes the buildings a little over 100 years old, so you've probably seen plenty of places with more history.  The architecture is Victorian, the shops and restaurants are tourist oriented, and the area is only a few blocks long, so it's easy to cover.  The best feature is the steam clock, especially if you're there when it plays a steam whistle version of the Westminster chimes (at least that's what I think the tune is).","July 28, 2012",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:38:27.905209,2021-06-18 20:38:27.982287

Trip to Canada,,"Gastown was great. There is so much to see and do. The area has a lot of history to it. However, do not venture beyond Gastown to the south once you reach the eastern most end. The area gets iffy really fast. There are plenty of restaurants in Gastown, galleries, and gift shops. Watch what you buy because you my find it elsewhere cheaper. Also, if you park on the street be aware the meters do not take the new Canadian coinage and the homeless jam up the meter and retrieve the coinage later. Ran into that problem. So either use a credit card or pay by cell phone. This way you will not loose a bunch of money in the meters. By the way, the ticket is $35 CA. I was told this by the merchants who line the street.

"Not for the faint of heart, unless wise and educated about the area.",,"First off I must stress that the location of Gastown is right next to Heroin Alley and the nucleus of all the junkies, druggies, crazy, homeless, distraught, vagrants, and freaking weird people. The center all this mess is basically at the intersection of hastings and main street. Within a 5 block radius, you will come across many a junkie, with frequencies rising the closer you get to the the aforementioned center. I only wish to convey this cleary because my girlfriend and I were walking through on Water Street and were passing a doorway to a shop and saw a a junkie with a syringe shooting up something, heroin, crack, i dont know, he then pulled out the needle and started to rub his face like he was really tired. I have never been so close to that sort of thing and it just really didnt sit well with me throughout the rest of the day. From what ive been reading that sort of thing can happen in plain sight quite often.  The place can be very distrubing if you come across the wrong people. Other than the the thrashy people, the gastown area is quite quaint and pleasant. The steam clock is great, its bigger than i thought and the steam can really cloud up above it. the main strip is cobblestoned road and sidewalk and thats always nice. The main square was really something. Its reminded me of a tiny old timesquare or something very similar to the five points in Gangs of New York with Gassy Jack overlooking the phole 5 way zone. The alleys in Gastown are something to steer clear of. We saw on the flyer a trounce alley and it was recommending checking it out, but it looked like every other alley in the East Downtown area. Very weary. The stores and restaurants in the area are very nice and well maintained. Prices are high as the place is a tourist attraction. Nothing crazy though. If it wasnt for the wild folks in the area it would be a good time, but for me personally, they tainted and semi ruined the experience. I recommend making a short trip of it, staying on water street seeing the steam clock and gassy jack towards the end and then getting the hell out of there.The city officials or government needs to do something about all those people ruining the area. Depending on your perception of the people, you will obviously have a different view on what to think of it all. I dont know how dangerous they can be to people, but im positive that theyre unstable and thats never as safe sober folks. I wouldnt bring my grandma here.","June 30, 2012",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 20:38:54.014108,2021-06-18 20:38:54.098434

Lots of people were bustling about, not just tourists but workers getting their lunch. We found a few interesting shops and I stumbled upon a wonderful fabric and haberdashery shop called Dressew which a TA member had told me about before I went to Vancouver but I had not realised it was here. As an avid sewer, I went in and bought some stuff to take home. It's a great shop for sewers and crafters with lots of stuff and cheap prices. Will be back next time I am here.Only one thing spoiled the walk; a guy bumped into me and was really aggressive and even though I said "" Sorry"" politely, he got aggressive and started following us so we ducked into a shop till he had gone!

Historical Cobblestone part of Vancouver,,"Thanks to Gassy Jack and the cobble stone streets and shops, Gastown is a great destination when visiting Vancouver.

"I like Vancouver, but Gastown is an eyesore",,"I found Gastown a little unsettling as well.  My wife and I went in the morning, and did the usual tourist stuff. In and out of their shops, but it has the look of a rundown part of town. We are from the Los Angeles area, and drug addicts and panhandlers are not an unusual sight for us. However, in Vancouver it was such a shame to see as the city has the potential of being a world class city.  I love the architecture and Stanley Park.  However, Gastown is worth about an hour, providing you can find a place to park. I will say the steam clock was fun to watch. I would recommend to the city father's of Vancouver, that is, do something about the panhandlers and drug addicts.  They will eventually drive away tourists, and put a blight on your beautiful city.","September 29, 2008",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 20:40:45.568836,2021-06-18 20:40:45.644363
Coolest spot in Vancouver,,"Just got back from Vancouver (Im from Toronto) and I thought Gastown was great! Its cool in that its really the only old part of the city I noticed. Really nice, well preserved buildings, but at the same time there is also a modern feel to the ares. Good reastuarants (Cobre was amazing), great patios to sit on and have a drink (Chill Wintson has two huge patios in a small square there) and some cool bars/clubs (I went to Blarney Stone, and Irish bar/club; mainly a university crowd). It also had a lot of shopping (which Im not one for, but my fiance dragged me around). She really liked the small local designer shops that are all over. (There were a few where I got stuff too) And some cool art galleries; I got some interesting BC native carvings. On a side note, while I did see a good number of homeless around there and was aware we were near a bad area, I never once was harrassed or felt in danger; I never really even thought about it. Actually, I saw that they had security walking around the streets all the time, so I guess that gave some added piece of mind.While I mainly went to Vancouver for the outdoors activities (which are many and a blast), Gastown was a definite highlight of my trip, so I thought I would share.","July 29, 2008",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 20:40:45.644368,2021-06-18 20:40:45.719620
Old glory,,"Fortunately, I didn't read the bad reviews here before I went to visit Gastown. I enjoyed it a lot. I also noticed that like in any other big city, drugs are everywhere in Vancouver, and in every social class, so let's stop pretending. Homeless didn't bother me as much in Chinatown or Gastown as in other parts of the city, so I'm surprised some of you mention them here. To those who were affraid to get out of their cars : maybe you should buy yourselves a home in Disneyland!To the owners of the area : great restoration job. The european roots are clearly visible, and I hope they will stay forever.","January 13, 2008",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.550222,2021-06-18 20:40:58.637013
Worth Seeing Once!,,"We visited Gastown mid-evening. There were loads of touristy stores with all sorts of Vancouver merchandise. There were also quite a few street people as well, though most did not bother us for money. We walked from the Lookout Tower area down to Gastown, but would recommend taking a taxi from Yaletown/BC Place areas as the streets surrounding Gastown were teeming with homeless people and less desirable scenery. The steam-powered clock was neat to see. Also, would recommend a meal at the Old Spaghetti Factory in Gastown, prices are reasonable and meals include soup/salad, entree, bread and spumoni ice cream for dessert. The interior of the restaurant is pretty cool as well, with an old trolley right in the middle of the dining room that you are able to dine in. Families with children would probably like this restaurant. It is worth seeing Gastown once though, if not just to eat at the Old Spaghetti Factory!","May 30, 2007",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.637018,2021-06-18 20:40:58.713005
pleasantly surprised after all the bad reviews,,"It seemed family friendly, touristy, yet  nicer, more authentic and tastefully done than the Americans do their touristy streets with shops.  perhaps the area has improved this year as it's scary only if you've never been outside of your living room.  only a couple of blocks, some distance out of the way, had the ""druggies and streetlife"", but they were too preoccupied with their own problems to bother anyone else it seemed that day.i gave it an above average rating because it was much nicer than i expected.  if my expectations would have been high, i would have given it a neutral or average, but then, i'm not big on these sorts of attractions.","October 22, 2006",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.713010,2021-06-18 20:40:58.794416
Don't be scared,,"Gastown is the oldest part of Vancouver. Great tourist shops and bars. Set up as a tourist area in the 1970s, it is currently being renovated and is a great place to see old Vancouver. Don't miss Storeyum, an excellent museum. Don't confuse Gastown with the Downtown Eastside, which is only a few blocks away. While there are many drug addicts on those streets, they are more a danger to themselves than anyone else. I work in the Downtown Eastside and I have never heard of a tourist being mugged (guns are rare in Canada too). On your way to Chinatown, stick to the main streets and you should be OK, though it is distressing to see so many people in such a terrible state. Don't miss Chinatown just because you want to aviod the Downtown Eastside. Next year (2007) Carrall Street will be made a green zone and you will be able to walk from the end of Water Street to the end of Chinatown (Pender Street) avoiding the worst parts of the Downtown Eastside, but even now you can walk without fear. As for the homelessness - Vancouver has a huge homeless problem in general and you will see it everywhere in the city. As the 2010 Olympics approach, many landlords who offer low-income housing are converting the buildings, creating a huge problem for the city.","July 15, 2006",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.794421,2021-06-18 20:40:58.872511
very dodgy area,,"I read all the hype about Gastown and Chinatown in the guidebooks but none of them mentioned the fact that they are surrounded by some of the worst areas of Vancouver.My wife and I walked to gastown once and didnt even get as far as china town because gastown is basically a couple of nice streets surrounded by drug dens, prostitutes, addicts cooking drugs in the street etc.. This should be mentioned in guide books because we were prime targets for a mugging but we followed the rule of head down and keep walking, no eye contact and no maps, wallet or camera in view.Saying that, it did at least have a high police presence which is more I can say for the ghetto areas of the UK.get a taxi to take you to the nice street and dont stray outside it.I am a firefighter so went over to have a chat to the Vancouver guys when they were at a job. They were stationed in or near gastown and couldn't believe we had walked through the areas I mentioned (and these are BIG guys I was talking to). Just that morning one of the firefighters had seen 2 muggings and a prostitute ""going about her business"" on his way to work. We were lucky to get off scott free he said!!At one point we walked past a park and at first thought ""phew, a park full of kids, we must be safer now"" - NOPE, as we got closer we realised they were not kids but groups of addicts. vancouver seriously needs to sort that area out because it is too close to the tourist area for comfort.","June 28, 2006",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.872517,2021-06-18 20:40:58.953028
My kids were scared to death,,"We drove through gastown, but didn't dare stop and get out of the car.  My children were almost in tears, because they were so scared.  Squalor, drug addicts, filth, graffiti - NO THANKS!","April 6, 2006",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 20:40:58.953033,2021-06-18 20:40:59.029355
Vancouver Heritage,,"As the birthplace of Vancouver Gastown is a must visit. Gastown is accessible from the Waterfront skytrain stop and is full of unique shops and restaurants. Highlights include the steam clock, blood ally, the statue of founder ""Gassy"" Jack found in maple tree square and Storyeum. Gastown has many historic buildings, including some very unusual triangular ones build because of land rights. In recent years Gastown has undergone a renovation and is now tourist friendly. Just be sure to say on Water Street (so called because the waters edge used to rise right up to steet level) - wandering too far off will lead you into some less desirable areas.","February 3, 2006",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 20:40:59.029361,2021-06-18 20:40:59.117128
Certainly a Daylight Adventure,,"Like other reviews, many homeless and drug addicts, some aggressive. The buildings are worth seeng, but the rest is just t-shirt shops and a couple bars.

Depressing Squalor,,"Vancouver is certainly a beautiful city, and Gastown boasts some of the oldest architecture in the country. Unfortunately, this is also home to the one of the worst drug cultures in North America. There are drug addicts, homeless people, and all manner of vagrancy everywhere you look. I've never seen anything like it. It was so depressing that we could hardly stand it. Also, the entire area was a ghost-town by midnight. Very creepy.","June 23, 2005",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 20:40:59.200035,2021-06-18 20:40:59.275127
