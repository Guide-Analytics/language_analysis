Unique Architecture!,,Vancouver continues to grow with the building of new architecture throughout the downtown core! Love the city even during these COVID times!,"May 23, 2021",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:19:31.906917,2021-06-18 17:19:32.001997
Natures beauty,,"Although I live in a suburb about 25 minutes to the city, as soon as I approach the downtown area of Vancouver I appreciate natures beauty. Separated by patches of water with a back drop of snow capped  mountains I admire the architecture of the tall towers that have added to the beauty of this city. The downtown core is easily accessible by walk or bicycles. Stanley Park, Beach Avenue, Gastown, Robson, Granville Island - oh, there is so much to do especially in the summer when it's warm and bright!¬","March 21, 2021",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:19:32.002004,2021-06-18 17:19:32.091658

Lively vibe and so safe,,"On this last trip we spent 6 days in Vancouver at 2 hotels...one on Burrard near Davie and the other on Burrard near Nicola.  We must have walked 20 Km at all hours of the day/night and enjoyed every minute of it.  Robson Street in particular was always lively.  Even some sections on Hastings at Main weren't ideal, but never felt unsafe.  Vancouver is such a walkable city.  We took advantage of the excellent Compass card when necessary, but really liked walking about.","October 18, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:19:32.210222,2021-06-18 17:19:32.299126

Our Favourite City in Canada,,"Great way to explore Downtown Vancouver is to walk around Yaletown and the Westend. Lots of places to shop and eat around Granville, Howe and Seymour Streets. We stayed in the International Village, which was reasonable, safe (despite a few homeless near the Arena) and an easy walk to Gastown, Coal Harbour and False Creek, where you can catch a Ferry to Granville Island.  We actually visited in April 2019, and only had 2 days to explore this beautiful city so on Day 1 walked form Chinatown, to Gastown, Coal Harbour and Stanley Park and then back through the central Westend back to Chinatown. Day 2 we took in Yaletown, Granville Island and Downtown and good way to explore. If we had longer a visit to the Capilano Bridge and  Butchart Gardens would be on the cards....maybe next time, if we ever get back! Although a short visit this was definitely the most beautiful and our favourite city in Canada.","July 23, 2020",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:19:32.397346,2021-06-18 17:19:32.509214

Vibrant,,Vancouver downtown is not an unusually large area and one can easily walk to Stanley Park and the aquarium (along the seawall is very pleasant and scenic) or through Yaletown (lots of restaurants) to the small ferrys to Granville Island (a great market). Walking from the wonderful Art Gallery along Robson Street (shops and restaurants) all the way to Denman and up Denman (lots more restaurants) to English Bay would take a little more than an hour.

Lots to do,,Make sure to check if there is an ice hockey game on! Rent a bike and ride around Stanley Park. Visit the op shops. Eat at all the waterfront restaurants.

The heart of life,,"It's like all other big cities, crowd and full of life. You can find Brands for shopping. Many events and so many happenings are taking place here.

An incredible city!,,"Vancouver as a whole is great! Get a hotel in downtown, and if the weather cooperates, you can walk to just about anything you want to see in the vicinity! We stayed near the stadium, visited Chinatown, the gayborhood (Davie Street), Yaletown, and the waterfront by the Ferries all on foot! The one downside we found with the downtown area is the widespread illicit drug use and the debris from it being strewn about. We saw countless syringes with needles attached on the sidewalks (huge safety hazard), crack pipes, and more. Main things: watch your step (and your back) and you’ll have a great time!","March 1, 2020",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:19:44.832289,2021-06-18 17:19:44.932806
Vancouver in February,,"If you are trying to get away from snow and cold, Vancouver is not a bad place to be. Unfortunately, the city's charm is declining rapidly as glass and steel condos replace old historical homes and buildings.Also, the transit system does not allow your dogs on board as regular passengers and cabs will often not take them so travel around the city is difficult if you want to take your best friends with you.Grocery stores downtown are also way over priced. You will work very hard trying to find a deal here. This is not a place to come shopping.Make plans to go to the woods and suspension bridges, go rafting or kayaking to get out of the concrete jungle and into the green.","February 29, 2020",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 17:19:44.932812,2021-06-18 17:19:45.028703

Clean and neat,,"I an from the Seattle area, and let me say going to Seattle now is scary! Street people everywhere, panhandlers and drugs. So refreshing to visit Vancouver BC where for the whole 3 day weekend I never saw anything like that!

A guided walk around downtown Vancouver by a local Vancouver Greeters.,,"We were blessed with a great tour guide from Vancouver Greeters.  He met us on our first morning in Vancouver and we walk for 4 hours in the wet gloomy morning around Vancouver Downtown, we did get a few brief glimpse of sunlight breaking through.  He gave a great overview of the downtown area.  He explained the history of the different landmark, the best continental biscuit on Davies Street and what makes Vancouver ticks.  We learnt so much in the 4 hours, we walk up Davies Street, all the way to Canada Place, saw the Steam Clock in Gastown, walk briefly through Chinatown and check out the shortest building there.  Walk through the free part of Dr Sun Yat Sen Garden and on to Olympic Park and False Creek.  We did stop for cheese cake and coffee at W. Hasting St.  Lunch was at Olympic park and we then took a ferry to Granville Island.  The ferry ride provides us a good view of downtown Vancouver from the creek.If you happened to visit Vancouver, I suggest contacting Vancouver Greeters and they will put you in touch with one of the volunteer guides and it is so much better to see Vancouver with the help of a local.","February 20, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:19:56.420686,2021-06-18 17:19:56.518434
Trip to Vancouver,,"Stay: This was my first time visiting Vancouver. I stayed at an AirBnb at Strathcona. This was my first time staying at an Airbnb. The house I stayed in was a heritage property. It was a unique experience. Nice and clean house. I chose this property looking at the reviews which were mostly 4+.However I think that I should have done some more research. The house had its own charm but as it was more than 100 years old, it had a different vibes and I found the interior dark and a bit smelly as it is a really old property. After travelling and experiencing various places in Vancouver downtown, I think pacific boulevard, west end, area close to Stanley park are better localities to stay. Commuting: Commuting within Vancouver is very easy and accessible. There’s a sky train and buses with a good connectivity. I flew in from Toronto to Vancouver. Took a sky train from the airport to go to downtown. Compass cards are available at the airport. It is like a “Presto” card in Toronto. One can load the card and use it with all kinds of transit within Vancouver. While staying at Strathcona, I discovered that East of Hastings is an area to avoid. You’ll see many homeless people on this street, drugs and other things. I was told to avoid this street. Best way to discover any place is to walk around. I discovered so many places by just walking around in downtown. I feel more connected to a place by walking around. Uber service is not as good as toronto. However they do have a local taxis available.GASTOWN and YALETOWN: These two areas are very vibrant and lively. It’s the place to be for youngsters. Lot of restaurants and shopping. SHOPPING: There’s a shopping mall in downtown, CF PACIFIC CENTER. Good place to hangout if it’s raining in Vancouver😊There’s another mall at Burnaby which is bigger than Pacific Center I think. Mc Arthur, great luxury outlet mall at Templeton, close to YVR airport. If you are looking to spend some time before your flight, this would be a great option.Food: Lot of food options, google for your choice!","February 12, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:19:56.518440,2021-06-18 17:19:56.610987
City a pleasure to do business in,,With Vancouver being such a walkable city it’s always a pleasure to conduct business downtown. Safe and easy to get around.

A walkable city,,"Whether you find yourself in Coal Harbour, Gastown, Granville Island, Yaletown, or (my favourite) neighbourhood the West End, you will find that there is much to see and do simply by walking around. Vancouver is a very walkable city but naturally there are other transportation options available. Unless you have the American dollar's 30% advantage be forewarned that fall, winter, and spring are the seasons to visit as accommodation prices skyrocket in summer.","February 3, 2020",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:19:56.803103,2021-06-18 17:19:56.898697

Great vibrant atmosphere,,"Definitely recommend to take a walking tour around downtown Vancouver to grasp the young and most vibrant city in the world. Full of world’s best museums and art galleries, authentic Canadian shops and local fresh seafood restaurants as well as international cuisine offering world class dining experience. While in Vancouver, you must try BC local wine which is definitely a world class wine and craft beer from local breweries.

Not as nice as it should be,,"Downtown is unofficially divided up into divisions. Along the seawall the view is spectacular and the areas are clean and inviting. Alberni and Robson streets are the high end shopping areas with a plethora of good restaurants. Unfortunately, the city has let Granville deteriorate dramatically in the last few years. Homeless are everywhere, the garbage seems to never be picked up. Further north, where cruise ships dock is Gastown, an interesting mix of independent shops and tourist traps. But it has interesting architecture and a good vibe. But when it ends, about 5 blocks east of the pier, the worst area of Canada appears. Although only a few blocks big, it is the center of drugs,  addiction, homelessness and despair. However, I have walked in that area many times and never been accosted or threatened. A lot of the people are in desperate straits but they are not criminals. Just be aware.","January 7, 2020",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 17:20:06.472377,2021-06-18 17:20:06.593619

Concrete Jungle Core Of An Otherwise Beautiful City.,,"Looking at a map, you will find that Vancouver Downtown is the lower portion of a peninsula (the thumb) of the main city of Vancouver (the fist), which sticks out into the Burrard Inlet. The neighborhood is bounded by the Burrard Inlet to the north, Stanley Park and West End to the west, False Creek to the south and Downtown Eastend to the east.It has the main business district of Vancouver as well as many high end residential buildings and hotels. As we walked the streets we saw a number of shops, restaurants, pubs, private offices, travel agencies and government offices, theaters and art galleries. In general the streets were clean and broad but there were a few places which were not so pleasant to walk along as there were some down at heel people and addicts to be seen. There were some parks and green spaces to relieve the monotony of the high-rises. A walk along the Waterfront Road was quite fascinating as we got to see the many activities in the harbor, near Canada Place, with the ships and boats moving in and out and a number of seaplanes taking off and landing.The main transit hub of Vancouver Downtown, the Waterfront Station, is where you can find connections to most parts of the city. There are two metro lines, The Canada Line and the Expo Line, the West Coast Express Railway, and the SeaBus passenger ferry which crosses the inlet to get you to North Vancouver.The road traffic especially during office hours can be quite slow moving, so we used the cheaper and efficient bus transit system instead of hiring expensive cabs. We enjoyed exploring the city, which is known to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world for a tourist.","January 2, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:20:06.781320,2021-06-18 17:20:06.866808

Avoid downtown Vancouver at all costs.,,Avoid downtown Vancouver at all costs. Way too crowded and traffic snarls for no apparent reason. There are so many things to see in this beautiful city but NEVER Drive a car here ever. Public transportation MAY make it doable. But we have no experience with that so it may be a slow slow drag too! Traffic jams are world class and absolutely ruin any fun unless you have made zero plans that are time sensitive. The many people we have met are charming and helpful. But avoid downtown and any crowded nearby area.

A visit to the Cathedral proved interesting, since much of the interior was wooden. There seemed to be a powerful respect for pedestrians every where, while the pedestrians had a similar respect for traffic lights, with almost no crossing against lights, so common in other large cities.

Due to the cruise ship passengers the buses were crowded and schedule was unreliable as buses were on one hour spaces and if the bus was full you were passed up.

Vancouver is a Dump,,"Visited Vancouver for the first time over the weekend. What a dump. What a let-down. Do an internet search for Vancouver and you'll notice a ton of pics of the overexposed downtown, Whistler and the gondolas there, and the snow-capped peaks. That's the hook - to get you to associate the two. If you're expecting the Canadian version of Seattle, that is, a cool, hip, vibrant, bustling, cultural, clean city nestled between the water and the mountains, you're wrong. The city has a typically Canadian metropolitan 1970's Soviet Bloc feel with it's graffiti-covered, soulless, uninspired, grey, concrete buildings. Even the public library building, which was apparently modeled after the Colosseum ruins in Rome, comes across as an anxiety-inducing MC Escher-esque claustrophobic, interminable nightmare. There are pot-smoking hippies and homeless everywhere. In many ways it's a typical Canadian metropolitan area - like Montreal. But Montreal has an amazing history and a ton of cultural outlets to keep you engaged.

Unfortunately, the service is generally mediocre (unless you are very lucky) but I felt an obligation to pay as it is the custom in Canada.

Public washrooms are really scarce in downtown and parking is limited to two hours as a maximum or is excessively pricey in private parkings into our opinion.

We were puzzled at first at how run down the Sun Yat Sen garden was and then appalled at the scenes on the surrounding streets. I thought San Francisco’s drugs/homeless problem was terrible (tho not in its Chinatown) but this was unbelievable, especially for Canada. People, mostly men and white, were lying by the dozen per block, all over the pavements openly surrounded by drug paraphernalia and off their heads. The sheer scale of this human degradation nightmare was like something out of a horror film about some distopian future. How on earth can the city be promoting this area as a tourist attraction when instead it should be warning people to avoid it at all costs? Interestingly we saw very few actual Chinese people there - I suspect they have mostly been hard working, economically successful and moved away, leaving the vacuum to be filled by a tragic white underclass.

Wow! It's a great city.,,"If you are even a moderate-ability walker, you will be able to visit many interesting sections of the city on foot.  We stayed at the Georgian Court Hotel on Beatty Street, and it was 2.5 easy miles up Robson Street, a terrific shopping district, to Stanley Park with the horse-drawn carriage tours and aquarium. That's about as far as you need to go -- the Vancouver Lookout, Gastown with its steam clock and shoppes, and Chinatown and sports venues are all closer in.   There are literally hundreds of restaurants on your doorstep.  If you get tired, stop at any of the many sidewalk cafes that sell bubble tea, an oddly tasty concoction of a milk and flavor combination (your choice of flavors) that has some sort of gastronomical ""bubbles"" on the bottom that you drink up through a wide straw.

She got  a ticket and ask officer to waive it... they did it for her since she is visiting the place and exceed 10 mins.... they gave her warning but thats it.But in Vancouver they never give any chanceswe also paid parking for going inside flea market! And then paid entrance fee which is $1.50 each to go inside! Not a friendly place. Not a place to visit! Would never suggest friends to visit if they ask for my opinion.

Gorgeous Setting. Cold People,,"Unbelievable beautiful setting. Almost magical. Unfortunately so many downtown buildings, primarily the high rise condo's are empty. Foreign investors simply bought them for a Real Estate asset and not to live. The empty Condo's add nothing to the city. To this, there is the fact Vancouver is a center of foreign adventure. So many Asian kids attending paid schooling in many suspect colleges. Many foreign adventurers passing through. Hard to find the nitty gritty of those that built this city. Seems it has been turned over to outsiders lock stock and barrel. It is therefore cold as attempting to break into new circles is complicated by the ethnic mix and for others the simple fact you are an unknown. Restaurants? Fantastic. World class. Hole in the walls. Fantastic. World Class. Nothing you cannot find. Food trucks add to the variety. Simply outstanding. Better Chinese food locally than anywhere in North America. Some from Hong Kong say even better than Hong Kong. Maybe a stretch but great regardless. Traffic is a joke. Bike lanes totally mess up downtown manuverability. Stores are unattractive. The entertainment area interesting but pedestrian at best.A city looking for an identity. Trust it is found.

P!NK Concert and a shady Airbnb at 565 Smithe Street,,"Wonderful visit to Vancouver for the first time.   The weather was awesome, P!NK was amazing, the people were all very friendly.   We stayed in an Airbnb that was overpriced and not very clean.  (Disgusting black hairs in the shower, a smoke alarm that beeped all night long and a host that wasn’t accommodating and willing to make our stay any better or compensate for the  inconveniences.) Our first Airbnb experience.  I don’t think I’d do that again.  The Airbnb was all hush hush about the location and we were instructed not to tell anyone that the condo we stayed in at 565 Smithe Street on the 10th floor was in fact an Airbnb.  The host (Kiera) made it clear that we were not to speak to the concierge at all.      The location was awesome however, right in the heart of downtown.

Livable downtown,,"Unlike some larger cities where the downtown business district shuts down, Vancouver does not.  It is home to many highrise dwellers which if you are lucky enough you can walk to work but likely live in smaller accommodations without children.  Those with children tend to try to get more space and likely end out in the suburbs.  Downtown is safe to walk day or night and fairly clean.  Durin the summer some parts of Granville or Robson street is closed to vehicles to make it more safer for the increased volume of pedestrians.  There is shopping, restaurants, movie and performance theatres, night clubs, hotels, and smaller grocery stores.  You can get away from having a vehicle and walk to all your self care services but could take the transit system to get around or rent a bicycle or vehicle. Not far is the seawall where you can walk, ride your bike or rollerblade around town, just beautiful if only you can do one thing to check out our city.","December 2, 2018",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:26:28.276211,2021-06-18 17:26:28.372615

There are quite a few homeless people with drug or alcohol problems in certain areas, but although sad to see, we certainly weren't hassled by anyone.  The downtown is so beautiful, and almost completely surrounded by water, it's amazing!  We've recently retired and are considering coming back to visit for a few weeks each year, as a break from our colder Ontario winter.

A World Class City,,"Loved Vancouver from the minute I  got there. Took the train from airport to downtown stop. From there is was a short walk to my hotel. The downtown core is very well organised with wide streets and considerate people. I was very lucky to get good weather on 5 of my 8 days there (in November) - thank you Global Warming.... I think.The area around downtown - including Gastown, Yaletown, Mt. Pleasant and Kitsilano are all very nice. Gastown is very hip and busy, Yaletown an upscale mix of residential and retail while Kits has a relaxed vibe. If you like to walk, bring your running shoes. You can get to all the above places on foot and enjoy tremendous views of the city. Stanley Park is not to be missed either.  Cross Lion Gate bridge if you have no fear of heights.Very good food, the coffee is generally too bitter for my liking (but clearly the locals like it like that). Excellent shopping - I got lucky again in that more than half the shops had 30 to 40% discount while I was there. The city is very green - which I appreciate. Excellent public transport system, bike share and car share (Car2Go) programs as well as recycling bins everywhere. The air is about as clean as you can ask for in a large to medium size city. The tap water is delicious.  Plenty of healthy vegetarian food options and tons of good Asian food.Amazing views from my hotel room - I highly recommend the Blue Horizon Hotel for good location, efficient staff and those views. Ask for a room on a higher floor.I’ve travelled a fair bit and my impression till now was that Rio de Janeiro is the most beautiful city.

It really put us off going out in the centre. We even heard gun shots when visiting the Chinese garden and later found out someone had been killed just a few blocks away.

Worthy of a stop is the famous city market which is waterfront, a boat tour while your there, and a side trip to botanical gardens that offers a spectacular view of the Vancouver skyline.

Huge bustling city,,"I wasn't long in Vancouver so this is just an intial snapshot view. Much like most cities it's a fairly fast paced place with lots going on. I found it expensive but maybe that's just the value of the British pound. The harbour area is pretty stunning. A busy place with the sea otter taxis flying in and out, ferries, a paddle steamer and swarms of tourists. Traffic is generally a hazard so be careful when you step off a pavement! Personally I'm a confident driver but would think twice before hiring a car for a short stay. Public transport is good.The big down side for me is that the city seemed to have a real homeless problem or issue.

Here and there are scattered small parks and we could see many buildings have trees/shrubs/grass on their rooftops and balconies. Some streets also have trees. It was nice to see greenery amongst all the cement and glass. We walked to the harbor where the cruise ships dock. Very nice seaport walkable area and park.

Library area/Robson St.,,"While the term ""downtown"" is sort of general and seems to encompass a large area, our experience with the area around the big (and beautiful) public library and also Robson St. has been nice.

We are told that the rooftop garden of the library is being renovated and will open sometime during the fall, so if you are in the area then, it sounds like it'd be worth a visit.We have walked up Robson St. for a bit and been to a nice restaurant and even did some shopping (shoes for me and a Canucks jacket for my husband).  In addition to all kinds of smaller stores, there are some big ones, too, like a huge glossy Nordstrom.

Also the trip to the Capilano Suspension Bridge is fantastic...if a little overpriced. Gastown and Granville Island are also nice places to visit. The main drawback about Vancouver is the homelessness you experience on every street in the downtown area. It's a real eye opener, and whilst I experience homelessness in London at home this is a different level. It's right in your face, with groups of homeless people camped out on some streets. Clearly there is a huge drug problem linked to many of the homeless people here....it is like something from The Walking Dead (seriously). One of the worst we witnesses was a lovely childrens playground with lots of kids playing.....with a homeless person laying no more than 10 feet away on the pavement with her trolley full of clothes. It really put a downer on the experience for us and due to this in the main I doubt we will be returning.

Vacation 2018,,"Stayed in the City Center at The Hyatt Regency Vancouver.   We were within walking distance of downtown, Gastown, tons of shopping, restaurants etc.  Love downtown Vancouver, it's a beautiful city with so much to offer travelers.   Took the hop on hop off tour which gave an excellent overview of Vancouver from Stanley Park to Chinatown and so much in between. Would highly recommend a visit. Make sure to stay in the city because it makes it a lot easier to get around making better use of your time while here.  We had thought about staying in a nearby town about 20 minutes away.  This is without traffic.  Trust me, after you factor in traffic you will spend at least an hour each way if you stay outside Vancouver.   We were going to stay in Surrey,  but decided that everything we wanted to do was in downtown.   Saved a bunch of time by staying in the middle of the action.  It was definitely worth spending a little bit more on the hotel and being close to everything.   Also being on a higher floor have us phenomenal city views.","July 29, 2018",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:29:55.511028,2021-06-18 17:29:55.592802

A Tale of Two Cities,,"Overall, I found Vancouver to be a beautiful and vibrant city, with pockets of charm scattered here and there. The great thing about Vancouver is its accessibility to parks, mountains and waterways just minutes from the downtown core. It definitely has a laid back feel to it, and lacks the fashionista sense that imbues cities like Toronto and Montreal. People are friendly and down to earth. There is never a shortage of things to do and see. However, as world-class as Vancouver is, it also has a huge socio-economic issue with a massive population of homeless, mentally ill and drug addicted people living on the streets of the downtown eastside (East Hastings and Main being the epicentre of the 10 blocks known as Skid Row). How the city allows this problem to exist and fester is beyond my understanding, especially when one of its main drivers of growth is the tourism industry. To have so many down and out people living on the streets, doing drugs in broad daylight, and basically milling about looking for their next fix is completely heartbreaking. This is something that obviously has no quick solution. I was in Vancouver back in 1994 and even then this problem existed, although not to the extent that it does today. If it wasn't for this overwhelming issue, I would have given this review 5 stars.","July 22, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:30:21.143356,2021-06-18 17:30:21.235637
July 2018,,"We took the float plane over from Victoria. I highly recommend enjoying the float plane views during your trip if you are going to Victoria or up to Whistler. We stayed at the UBC, rode bikes around Stanley Park, visited Granville by ferry, went to Gastown - there were an abundance of shopping and food experiences. Parking in Vancouver is expensive.  We.visited Chinatown and were sad to see that the East side of the City shows a neglected side of Vancouver. So many homeless people and several people using drugs (shooting up) in on the street or entryway to abandoned buildings and alleys. I certainly would not have felt safe in the evening.  Paramedics patrol the Gastown/Chinatown/East side on bikes.  The city has a ton of character, I think it needs to invest in solutions for helping some of the residents.","July 21, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:30:21.235643,2021-06-18 17:30:21.317084
A great area to stay,,"We went totally ""blind"" in our choice of hotel and with Coast Coal Harbour Hotel in the middle of Downtown, our stay was 1st class. Just close to the waterfront, we were 5/10 minutes walk from the harbour trip boats and Stanley Park in one direction and 5 minutes walk from Canada Place in the other. Slightly longer to walk up up Robson Street for the stylish shops. All in all Downtown is lively, full of restaurants and bars, interesting with great views of the marina and mountains - and as for the seaplanes, they have to be seen and sampled to be believed. We loved this area and were so fortunate in our ""blind"" choice. There are of course other hotels in the area which looked just as good as ours with access to the same local amenities but as we did not use those hotels, we cannot comment - but they cannot be bad can they in such a lovely area?

Some good points but overall disappointing.,,"We had high hopes for the city of Vancouver, but ultimately walked away disappointed.   While the city does have some pretty spots like Stanley Park, Canada Place, and Gastown, overall it is seedy and not well kept, with panhandling homeless everywhere.  Many areas are very sketchy and not safe at night at all.  Also the taxi situation is absolutely ridiculous.  There are no cab stop lines anywhere, and even downtown it can be very difficult to find a cab.  In places like Stanley Park they are nonexistent, and unlike most cities where major tourist attractions draw plenty of taxis, even at those locations there are none to be had.   You really must have a private driver or rent a car in Vancouver in order to get around effectively.","July 18, 2018",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 17:30:21.558306,2021-06-18 17:30:21.652227

The Seawall offers a scenic walk. Plenty of dining options - ranging from old Pubs to swanky new restaurants and cafes. Multiple shopping complexes and malls, small retail outlets and kiosks all jostle for attention even to casual browsers like myself.Ethnic neighbourhoods like Chinatown are also a short distance away.One downside I note which was perhaps less obvious back in 2009 is the number of homeless individuals living on the streets with some of them politely asking for financial assistance.","June 21, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:31:38.540499,2021-06-18 17:31:38.631135

Everything for Everybody,,"Downtown Vancouver is a small area filled with everything you might want to see and do. Many area of ethnic variety. Gastown where vancouver  started is filled with many site and historical adventure. See where ""Gassy Jack"" started his business and the statue of him at the entrance from the east. Many little shops and well as someone said  ""tourist Trap"" of vancouver, I you want to find something with Vancouver on it, this is the place to go, but do be ""BUYER BEWARE""  and some things are not from Vancouver . Along the way you will find many shops and many restaurants either for just a stop in or to find a cold drink. This is also the home of the famous Gastown Steam Clock  which is a great attention grabber. It goes off every 15 min and counts down the hours at the top of the hour.  You can find anything for beer to coffee and pizza to a full coarse meal in this area. Canada Place is our local Cruise ship and Convention area, many spend their time in this area.. complete with an underground shopping center. YES it does rain in vancouver  but the locals call it  ""Liquid Sunshine"" .. While in this area you can  see FLY OVER CANADA  which is a thrill experience  As you experience the rest of the down town there are many areas still to see. The shopping district is right in the center of downtown. Robson Street (named after one of our priemiers)  is great for finding some of the name brands stores along with that Alberni street is next street over , where you find lots of shopping and restaurants . Many many places to Eat all along both streets.. One thing you will notice in Vancouver is the Food trucks, and cornor stands  with our famous JapaDog stands . Very interesting hot dogs.  As you move a little further into the city you can take a left and head to Yaletown which was at one time the hub of our Rail and Wharehouse district, BUT now is a residental and business area.  Many shops and so many restaurants This area is a great area to check out.. In the evening check out Mainland st for the best of restaurans from easy to full upper scale dining can be found. the Bluewater comes to mind.  Just so many things to do in Yaletown,  you can see the Yaletown roundhouse which gives you an Idea of where all the trains and history of Vancouver comes from.. as you keep going you can find yourself at the Seawall, which is  a walkway that can take you almost 26 kms around the city.. Beautiful for a great walk around the whole city.. Along the way you will find the beautiful Sunset Beach area  which then flows into the English Bay area where we have a nice beach (Summer late July/August) you might be lucky enough to catch one of the International Fireworks competitions, or maybe the first Sunday in Aug you might find the LGBT2+ Parade which usually gathers about 700,000 people . This is also the entrance of Davie Street which  has the local Gay Village along with the Rainbow Crosswalks  and the many shops and eaterys of the West End. you can also follow the sea wall all the way around Stanley Park. BUT DONT STOP THERE as the whole of 1000 Acres or 470 hecters of Land await you in this world famous Stanley Park, included in your walk within Stanley Park is every thing from Lawn bowling  the mini golf to the many many trails for biking and walking (rent bikes for additional fun)  also in the park in the 9PM gun which you can hear from most of downtown.. Brockton Point where the old lighthouse is located.. Of coarse also included is the Aquarium (paid entrance) .  Also you can keep going and end up at Prospect Point which has lots of History and you can stop for a snack or a full meal .  or just simply the best ice cream in Vancouver. Also one of the best place to view the world known Lions Gate Bridge.   As you keep going around the inner park you will find the historic Hollow Tree a must stop for pictures. Keep going and you find your self coming down the hill past a couple more of the trails  to The Teahouse Restaurant with all its history and now a Restaurant. the views from there are fantastic and also a favorite for Weddings  (Reservations in summer a MUST)  as you keep going around the park you will find yourself next to Lost Lagoon and all the wild geese and ducks and a beaver or two, which you can see from the trails. Keep going around and you find yourself leaving the park and going along a pathway that take you to Coal Harbour, where you will see all the boats and glory of Burrard inlet, From here you can take a float plane tour over Vancouver or if you want to try you can fly to Victoria on beautiful Vancouver Island. .. I hope this has given you a basic peek at what VANCOUVER is . Also you can even book your own private tour either for yourself or your family.  A LUXURY PRIVATE TOUR  gives you all of the above and even more .  You can get your own personal guides and makes stops . Think China Town Gastown Granville Island public market  Queen Elizabeth park.. The Wonders of Vancouver await you . I am sure once you have seen the sites of Vancouver you will be back for more..  I live here (if you could not tell)  ENJOY MY HOME CITY..","June 4, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:32:12.013133,2021-06-18 17:32:12.093897

A mixed bag!,,"In terms of beauty and surrounding scenery there a few places that can rival Vancouver. However the city really needs to do something about its homeless problem. Such a beautiful city and then turn round the corner and there any many many homeless that are not being cared for. I found this so surprising because the city gives off such a cosmopolitan vibe. We were approached more than ten times by homeless and the mentally ill asking for money or shouting/saying something weird. Some areas are worse than others, parts of east hastings street and Chinatown were particularly bad.

The upscale shopping area was free of homeless people and was very clean it seemed.  Very busy and it seemed safe.

Continue to Gastown by way of the historic Waterfront Railway Station and the statue of the angel and soldier beside it. In Gastown see the steam clock and visit the souvenir shops that sell lots of Canadian themed items. The city is clean and safe to walk in although check with your hotel about a couple of areas around Hastings Street you may wish to avoid if you are going over to Chinatown. Obey the traffic lights as traffic tends to be very heavy at time. Lots of good shopping and eating opportunities downtown.

While one can have more fun with the quaintness, geography, and uniqueness of a place like San Francisco from right in front of the houses, hills, cablecars, or buildings, it is the uniqueness of the natural environs of Vancouver that make it much the more beautiful a place from afar. The combination of mountains and water that surrounds the place are quite unique and eye-catching. For the most part, downtown is eminently compact, flat, and walkable. There is a great variety of ethnic foods, many offering unique takes on the natural food sources here--which includes great sea food.","March 28, 2018",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:33:39.145872,2021-06-18 17:33:39.228710

Downtown Vancouver looked very much like Upper East/West Side of Manhattan in most parts, think 5th Ave or Madison Ave. While the shopping district reminded me of Times Square.

Nice City On The Water/Excellent Convention Facilities/But a Serious Cab Problem,,"We’ve been to Vancouver a half dozen times now on business conferences/conventions, and really like the city; nice clean downtown, a lot of nice restaurants and shopping areas, and a lot of nice hotels.  Here’s our one gripe:  No Uber, No Lyft, and if you ask a restaurant to call a cab for you, they tell you the obvious:  don’t waste your time because it will take forever to get here, if they come at all.  What?  How do you expect convention business with that situation.  We were told to “aggressively” hail cabs.  All well and good, but if you go to one of Gastown’s restaurants, good luck getting a cab....after waiting 15 minutes to hail one, the cabbie said he doesn’t go there very often during the day since there’s not much a demand; and at night it’s crazy with the bar scene so he prefers to avoid it.  Go to Yaletown restaurants, same thing.  So Vancouver Tourist Authority:  here’s the message:  WE WANT UBER/LYFT ride services where we go so we can get transportation to and from where we want to go; and we like paying by app since it doesn’t involve cash, and we don’t use credit cards with cabbies since we have had problems.  So get real if you want tourists/business conference people.  You have a serious problem here with that.

We were driven through Stanley Park, Chinatown, and other areas.Later, we took a boat taxi to Granville Island—across from the downtown—with its good shops, marketplace, and eateries. The only caveat is that a few blocks from a nice section there might be a seedy one in the downtown. So stay aware of your walking routes and surroundings. And there are no Uber taxis in Vancouver, so you will have to drive or phone for a cab (since it is difficult to flag an empty one down on the streets).","December 3, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:35:17.086873,2021-06-18 17:35:17.167372

World-class city with endless sights and activities,,"Okay, so I am very biased with this being my hometown. However, after travels to many cities I can say that this is the one of the most beautiful, clean and safe places on the planet. Activities are too numerous to list in a review but indoor or outdoor, active or leisurely, Vancouver has it all. There's easy access to the heart of downtown via public transit.There is something to be said for some people's assessment of the downtown buildings as a concrete jungle but that is slowly changing. While there are some areas that offer late night activities as a whole the city shuts down relatively early. Walking most streets is quite safe.Everybody's tastes are different but if need a Top 3 of things to do/visit I suggest Stanley Park, Gastown and Yaletown. Being in the Pacific Northwest it does rain but contrary to what most think it's not always wet. You will usually avoid a lot of rain from May through mid-October. I always tell peole that if weather and crowds are a factor in your decision then visit in September. It can still be quite warm, there's less people relatively low humidity and it's surprisingly dry most years.","November 4, 2017",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:35:49.756570,2021-06-18 17:35:49.839020

Tip for maple syrup - get it from a supermarket as it is much cheaper for the same thing and often better selections.  In Granville St above Best Buys (an electrical and camera store) there is a shop called Winners.  Like a UK TK MAXX and sells loads of things very cheap and a lot are the same as you can buy in better stores but at a knockdown price.Downside are the professional beggars who are sleeping rough at a lot of the large intersections but they do no harm so just move on.","October 8, 2017",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:36:26.251661,2021-06-18 17:36:26.555833

One of The World's Truly Beautiful Cities,,"There are few cities in the world that can compare with Vancouver. It is a multi-cultural and extremely friendly city. There is a young population here, so a great city to people watch. The city is stunning, well laid out and very clean.

People here care about their city. Littering is rare, but there are always many people employed to clean up.There are some great places to see, such as the old city and steam clock; Stanley Park; Capilano Suspension Bridge in North Vancouver and the waterfront area with its vibrant social scene - cafés, bars, restaurants, etc. IUt is lovely to sit in Stanley Park with a coffee, watching the wildlife and the seaplanes coming and going.

4 days to explore after Alaska Cruise,,"Went w another couple. Stayed at L'Hermitage Hotel. Excellent place to stay and worth the price! Very easy to walk around downtown and felt safe despite some homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks 🙁 also another big negative for me was how dirty the city was. Just so sad that they don't pick up the trash and empty the trash receptacles that are overflowing everywhere. And this was before the Gay Pride Parade and activities over the weekend. Sidewalks and streets need to be cleaned! That part was very disappointing. We went to Miku Japanese place and highly recommend it! Sushi melts in your mouth (the hot sushi - not kidding). Guys got the Wagyu steak and just loved it. Also got shrimp and Brussels sprouts for 2 appetizers. They were awesomely tasty!Enjoyed fantastic live music EVERY night at Fairmont Hotel in the bar. Good choice of bar munchies (a little pricey) and guitar musicians were just awesome!!Went up to the Vancouver Lookout tower. Price would have been worth it but with fire smoke couldn't see the beautiful mountains in distance. For lunch one day we ended up at this place called One Under. It's golf, beer and more. Great menu (healthy and not so) plus you get to swing golf clubs! You know when you try out clubs and hit into a screen? It's like that but set up like a bowling alley w about 8 diff screens. Can play a whole game but can't use your own clubs. It was an unexpected fun afternoon!Starbucks on every corner practically and nice shopping options you can walk to. The locals are very health conscious with a strong Asian influence on restaurants and food selection which I loved! But Americanized food available too. Locals are very friendly and I thought it was interesting that you don't hear horns honking like in most cities! 😊👍Also went to high end steakhouse - Gotham. It was good but not excellent. 3 stars as one steak was over cooked and our food took a really long time. Longer than others that arrived after us. But my filet was tasty and drink choices excellent. Had onion rings and another appetizer. They were good but nothing extra special. On your way back to US be sure to leave EXTRA time to get thru security and customs esp if you have am flight. It took us 1 hour and 30 min to get luggage checked and security, and customs. I was selected for extra screening but they were picking more to screen than not. Even staff member said OMG about the numbers! I really wanted to do the hop on hop off but our group wasn't up to do a lot of walking 🙁. Cabs very easy to get and reasonably priced. Overall I'm glad we stayed to explore Vancouver since we were all the way out there. I wouldn't make a trip out to see Vancouver specifically though. Wish they would spend some $$ to clean up their city because it is nice with so much to offer!","August 25, 2017",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:38:37.280685,2021-06-18 17:38:37.361352
Stay a Few Days Before/After Cruise,,"We only stayed one night before our cruise. Vancouver is a lively city. Very eco friendly. It is impressive to see so many trees everywhere, especially on building rooftops.We walked several miles.Tips- *There is a Costco downtown! Get only take MC NOT VISA like in the states. The don't  sell alcohol.*Buy wine at BC Liquors for your cruise. It is controlled sales. Must buy from a liquor store or your hotel.*Walking is easy, but sometimes hilly.There is some homelessness but mostly people are very friendly. We will visit again. I wish we planned on staying longer before our cruise. Canadian exchange rate for YS dollars is great right now. Best bet is to use your credit card.

Beautiful city!,,"Working on a cruiseline and got a chance to visit Vancouver downtown once a week. All i can say is, this city is very very tourist friendly. I love the food court in downtown, offers great selections of food and beverage, especially a sushi kiosk.. What not to love? 30cad for 2 sets of assorted nigiri and rolls, a box of blueberries and cherries, a box of chuka wakame. That's definitely a great deal! Do buy the famous inniskillin riesling, canadian mapple ice wine bonbon, and postcards!!

The skyline is spectacular as it is framed by the water and the mountains.  If you take an effort to learn how to use public transit, it would be a plus, with the Skytrain system (convenient as it goes to the airport) and the bus system.  Driving can be a little trying, especially in the downtown area as there are lots of one-way streets and lane closures due to many construction projects.

So many things to see downtown,,"I visited Vancouver for 4 days awhile back and the downtown is one of the best walking cities I have done yet. Sidewalks, lights, pedestrian courtesy and just the sights one can see. So many different things like Gastown, the false creek area, the downtown itself, Stanley Park, and all the roads, trails, and paths that intersect. The city is just meant for wandering and photo taking. Street photography, urban photography, nature photography is all at its best. Combine that with the weather in August and its a perfect storm for those that want to walk the city. I would advise all to simply get out of the tour bus or cab and use those feet to explore the city. Your rewards will be sore feet but also an appreciation of a wonderful city. I won't even mention the wonderful public houses, the brewpubs, and the great food that all contributed to a wonderful week's stay. Get over to Granville Island using an aquabus.

They close some lanes, reroute traffic in opposite directions, and cause huge traffic pile ups. It was just terrible. Every where we went by car, or by public transit, there was traffic.

A Different Kind of City,,"Downtown Vancouver may surprise you with the simple fact it is a neighbourhood where more than 100,000 people live. Due to city planning there is a lot of apartment blocks and towers and hence more people living in the downtown core. This also means there is a lot of services open till all hours and people on the streets and in the bars, restaurants, and coffee houses until all hours. This is truly a people area and there is no rolling up the sidewalks when the commuters go home.With the downtown bounded on three sides by water and being long and narrow driving down here is the crazy and the tourists. Use the Skytrain and the buses to get around when you travel a long distance but otherwise just walk. This is a walking city and enjoy being away from the cars. The sea wall runs from the port area on the northeast of the downtown around the entire peninsula and continues around False Creek towards Point Grey.

Our favourite spot was down on the harbour and at the Sailing Club watching the sea planes taking off.There is a long tidal reach and the shoreline changes quite markedly after 6 hours there.  the buses out to the ferry port at Horseshoe bay are impressively quick and very cheap but do take change to pay on board.Even if you haven't booked a cruise do visit Canada Place and watch the cruise liners arrive and depart for Alaska.

There is only one major highway running through the area, and it backs up most hours of the day until early evening. At least, that was our experience. It took an hour to get from Richmond to North Vancouver via back streets. Negotiating the bridges, tolls, and streets is a challenge given they loop over and around each other to cover the waterways.

A walkable and pleasant city,,"As a local resident, i find Vancouver downtown to be a safe, clean and pleasant area to live in. It is a young city with a lot of newer towers mixed in with some older buildings. The city centre is compact with everything you might need within easy walking distance. If you are visiting, I would recommend staying somewhere near a Skytrain station so you can travel around the area easily, The Canada Line is safe, convenient and inexpensive if you need to travel to or from the airport. Vancouver cannot pretend to compete with cities like London, Paris or New York as a tourist destination but the city has its charms that the vast majority of visitors appreciate. It is especially blessed with its setting near the mountains and sea, and the downtown has been designed to take advantage  of this. Vancouver does have its share of homeless people but they are rarely threatening or dangerous. I am a senior and I have lived downtown for decades and I have never been mugged or threatened, nor do I know someone who has been. There are not homeless people begging on every corner as some reviewers would have you believe. If one should ask you for ""spare change"" just say ""sorry, no"" and move on.There is one area located east of Gastown that tourists should avoid. It is called the downtown east side. It is an area where there area lot of drug users and down and out people. It is not a dangerous area, but it is unpleasant.  Vancouver is consistently rated as one of the best cities in the world to live in. There are good reasons for this. It is multicultural,vibrant and bustling, day and night. The presence of people on the streets at almost all hours is one of the reasons why it is so safe.

"Vancouver's great, but beware...",,"On a holiday visit to Vancouver, one evening we thought we'd explore the Gastown district and then walk to Chinatown for a bite to eat. An obvious route is down Columbia, but within 100m we found ourselves somewhere we didn't want to be. The street and alleyways were populated by those poor unfortunates whose lives depend on a ready supply of narcotics, and one such alley seemed home to scores of such people, in various states of disarray, none of whom wouldn't be there without the need. On Columbia there was a pharmacy whose sole purpose was betrayed by a barren exterior and tiny serving hatch. How can the city and its charities allow this, let alone so close to a tourist centre?  I have never seen anything like this in London or any other European city, and places Vancouver firmly in the same category as many US cities. We hurried on to Chinatown, only to find it closed and dead, so returned to Gastown by a different route. To be fair, Vancouver is worth a higher score, but to draw attention to this issue I must score badly. No one reads the good reviews!","August 3, 2017",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 17:40:07.920204,2021-06-18 17:40:07.997545

Had a great first nation guide/driver named Jeff.    We road the 2 day hop on hop off bus for transportation to and from our attraction destinations and some restaurants near their stops. Our tickets included a one way destination on the False Creek Ferry. We shopped a little in the Granville boutiques and especially enjoyed the farmers market and food court of Granville Island. We took a tour on one of the zodiak boats around the city and out among the moored tankers in the bay. We did the fly over Vancouver attraction at the Port of Canada  building.We caught the new movie, Valariun. We oohed and awhed at the Japanese Fireworks display enjoying a picnic dinner with friends.

The beautiful parts of the city were Gastown, Canada Place, Stanley Park and Granville Island areas.  I loved the laid-backness of the city and Canada as a whole.  People were polite and happy.  No wonder Canada made the top 10 list as one of the happiest countries in North America.  The only drawback that I have for not giving this city a 5 star rating is the homeless people on the streets and the smell of urine in some parts.  We were lucky to have sunny days and blue skies during the week of July.  It made the marina a picturesque scene for photos and not to mention the colours from the potted plants alongside the street.

Downtown is not what it used to be,,"The downtown core, most specifically Robson Street, used to be a lot more vibrant and interesting than it is now. There are many empty shops that now line the street. Greedy landlords that charge exorbitant rents have pushed many of the unique ""mom and pop"" shops from the area. Downtown Vancouver has become a city that caters to the über wealthy tourists. Shops like Prada and Tiffany now have a strong presence.  Unique businesses have been driven from the downtown core to make room for yet another condo complete with a coffee shop and nail salon.Walk through the area in the early morning and you can literally trip over one of the countless homeless people that sleep and beg in the street. If none of this turns you off, grab one of the plentiful Mobi bikes for hire, and take a spin through the Main Street area  where you can grab a beer form one of the local micro-breweries.

How I miss the Vancouver of the 70s!,,"Downtown Vancouver was once a spacious, charming, and wonderful city. Unfortunately that charm has now been buried under so many layers of nouveau-riche pretension that you'll think you're strolling down Rodeo Drive but with a lot more rain. Pradas face off against Guccis across double-parked Ferraris as far as the eye can see. It's nothing less than capitalistic excess to the point of disgust. You can't turn back the clock but in cases like Downtown Vancouver you'll wish you could.","July 13, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 17:42:25.931073,2021-06-18 17:42:26.006769
A Wonderful Three Day Stay.,,"We were in town for three days. The weather was warm and sunny. The city is easy to get around on foot/bike, if you're mobile enough, you don't need a car. The Sky Train is a good option to get you around on a day pass. We took our time to get around, as we were in no rush(on vacation). Day and night, there's plenty to keep you occupied. The big sky scrappers make you feel so small when looking up at them. Plenty of shops, bars, restaurants to go at in lot's of different districts. The waterfront area is a must place with all the cruise ships, along with watching the seaplanes, come and go. Take a stroll to English Bay, where you can chill on the beach. A little further on takes you to Stanley Park( great for families). We took so much in, with wonderful memories to take home with us.

Most beautiful city in the world and bike friendly,,"Having travelled to more than 60 countries in the world and hundreds of cities, I have to say that I think Vancouver is the most beautiful city in the world....on a clear day😊.  Nestled between the coastal mountains and the Pacific Ocean the city is nothing short of breathtaking.  Vancouver is a bike friendly city so, rain or shine, one of my favorite things to do is to get on a bike and go see the sights.  From downtown it's an easy 10k bike ride (make sure to go counter clockwise since the bike trail is one way) around Stanley Park with it's spectacular view of Canada Place, Coal Harbor and the float planes, the Totem Park, mermaid on the rock statue, Lions Gate bridge and English Bay beaches.  You can also do another 15 k bike ride all the way around False Creek and back to see Granville Island and Kitsilano Beach.  The trails are fairly flat and well marked.  Between Granville Island and Kits make sure to stop at Go Fish for the best fish and chips in the city and at the Boathouse Restaurant in Kits for an amazing view and a great Happy Hour.  If you are an intermediate or better biker you can do the 22km round trip trail from Kits up the Cypress Street trail to the Arbutus Trail and then turn right and take the Arbutus Trail across town towards the airport.  The Arbutus trail is built on an old railway line so the incline is not too steep.  The trail takes you past Kerrisdale and the shops and Cafe's on 41St.  If you follow the trail to the end make sure to take a right down the hill and then your first left to stop at the Milltown Pub and Marina for drinks and food.  The pub is on a strip of land between the marina on one side and the river on the other.  Here you can watch the planes landing at Vancouver International airport. If you are and experienced biker you can do these three rides together for approx 55km and it takes me 3-3.5 hrs depending on how crowded the traits are.","June 30, 2017",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:43:24.025020,2021-06-18 17:43:24.106789

The people are very friendly and we were happy to find ""street hosts"" walking around on the street offering to help you find places if you are having trouble finding anything (they wear badges).  Lots of construction and we understand from the locals there is a lot of foreign investment in the area, so whole neighborhoods are being bought out, single family homes being torn down and condos being build…row after row of them!  Only down side is the number of homeless people on the streets!  Most large cities have a homeless issue, it seems but it was very obvious in Vancouver.  Folks sleeping on the street, trash everywhere the homeless people were, dirty old guys peeing on the side of buildings, etc.  Folks begging were on each corner.  On a happier note, most of the city has a lot of gardens, flowers and most shop owners try to keep their part of the street clean.  It is an expensive city to visit, but, all major cities are anymore.  International place with folks from all walks of life.

"My favorite city on the west coast, unfortunately it is slowly decaying from the intrusion of people immigrating in.",,"Vancouver of old was jaw dropping and very British in feel.  The amount of class and sophistication oozed from every corner of the place.  Now?   No, it has gone downhill and the people living there now have lost all care and concern for this city.  Here is an interesting sentence I hear from many of my Sikh Indian and Hong Kong Chinese friends..   ""It isn't bad, it is much nicer than any city from where I am from..""   Yeah, famous last words.  My only reply and the complete look of not being able to comprehend it..   ""If you saw it 20 or 30 years ago you would look at what it has turned into and be shocked.  A once beautiful city has now been slowly turned into the garbage that is where the people immigrating in are from.  While it is still better than what is in Asia, it isn't going to take long before it is more like an Asian city than the Grand Lady she used to be.  It is interesting to talk with Canadians about it.  Years ago there was this blindness to it and that everything was just fine.  Now, I hear more and more discord from Canadians as they see the essence of their city being taken over and changed into something that they now feel powerless stop or change it back to what they once knew.    They sold their soul for an easy solution to their economic woes and there is no looking back now. What the future holds? More decay and what was once grand and proper fades, to be taken over with the greed and social decay that follows.","June 19, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:44:19.924398,2021-06-18 17:44:20.001700

Lovely city..... but some aspects not so pleasing,,The downtown area has a variety of restaurants that will cater for most tastes and pockets. Some parts of downtown seem to have a lot of homeless people and medicinal cannabis shops.

One of the best cities for walking.,,"We really enjoyed our walks in the city, the traffic isn't that heavy so the air is clean. The roads are on a grid system so it is easy to navigate especially as the vertical stands with maps showing where you are and a 5 minute walk circle, are every few blocks. The car drivers are polite and paitent with pedestrians and the system of countining down the seconds left still to get safely accross the road, takes out any last second dash to get over the junctions before the lights change. I was facinated by the different lamp posts in the different districts, there are distinct atmosphers (all good), as you walk or drive throughout the area.","June 1, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:45:42.826876,2021-06-18 17:45:42.909664
Vancouver and beyond,,"We found the local transit system was great.  Head for Canada Place, which is a great place to start exploring.  There is an information centre and Free shuttles to Grousse Mountain and Capilano leave from here.  You are basically just paying the entrance prices and get the bus for free or near enough.Dont miss Fly Over Canada, it is fabulous and ends with a view of the Northern lights. Worth every cent.Instead of choosing the 24 hour Hop on Hop off bus for $47 each or using normal transit bus and bikes, we made a mistake and hired a car to see Stanley Park. In Stanley park, in your own car, you do get to travel at your own pace and dont have to wait for buses, but parking is difficult if you go on a weekend, so you waste a lot of time.  I think the Hop on Hop off would have been a better, cheaper option for 2 people after all.We hired the car for 2 days and it ended up costing us $252 CAN, plus petrol.  The car hire itself was advertised as $42 a day in $US. The hire price did not include any insurance cover, that had to be added at $18 a day for basic car cover, or $45 a day if you wanted full collision cover, 3rd party and roadside assistance.  So much for travel insurance being sufficient here, its not.  So by the time you convert everything to $CAN and add the insurance it cost $126 a day.  Ouch!!  They do have 'Cars2Go' supposedly for $50 a day, but I dont know if that includes insurance.Driving up to Whistler was beautiful for the passenger.  As the driver you dont get to see as much, as the road is quite bendy.  We stopped at Shannon Falls and were blown away, it was so impressive.  We then took the pedestrian walk to the Sea to Sky gondola.  It proved to be a 7000+ steps walk through the forest and that included equivalent of 8 flights of stairs!  Beautiful, but exhausting.  I recommend you drive there instead. It is only just over 1km by road.Sea To Sky is a beautiful experience.  The scenery is lovely.  If you dont have all day, you could stop with this sight and not go on to Whistler, but while it is approx 850m high, Whistler is more than double in height.Whistler Village is a walking town and quite confusing to navigate by car.  Google was completely confused and sent us to the wrong place twice before we finally got directions from a local to the gondola station.The first gondola takes 30 minutes and goes straight up the mountain.  It is very, very high.When you get to the top, you can then travel on the Peak to Peak gondola which travels 4.4km between the peak of Whistler to Blackcomb mountains.  Unbelievable experience.You literally feel like you are standing on top of the world.Again, we were sorry we drove instead of taking a tour. We got so lost using Google maps we wasted well over an hour and had no time to explore the town of Whistler or visit Brandywine Falls. It was very frustrating.  On a tour you could relax and not have to worry about this.  However, I dont know of a tour that does Sea to Sky and Whistler.  They all seem to include Shannon falls and some include Brandywine fall.If I had to choose a gondola ride and had all day (12hours) I recommend Whistler tour.  Shorter tour just goes to Squarmish, which is where Shannon Falls and Sea to Sky are located.  You would not be disappointed.If you do drive to Whistler, there are 4 car parks called Lot 1 to 4 in Whistler Village.  Lots 3 and 4 are free parking, but a walk to the town.  Once you find these car parks head into town and you will find the gondola station.  Dont do as we did and go in the wrong direction again and end up at the closed chairlift to the Peak.  More frustration.If you enjoy Craft Beer, you will be spoiled for choice in Vancouver.  Easiest is to head to Gastown, which is an easy stroll from Canada Place.  Several venues there that serve a huge range of local beers and some great food.  Dont miss the Steam Clock, it is gorgeous.Dont miss Sky Tower.  Go during the day, go and have dinner, then go back to see the sun set, all on a single day ticket. I recommend the free guided tour too.Loved this city.","May 31, 2017",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:45:42.909669,2021-06-18 17:45:42.990871

The views at the waterfront are lovely and if you find a bench to sit on , you can spend an hour easily just watching life on the water and people passing by. I was very disappointed in the historic district of Gastown. Although small and quaint if you venture just a little off here you will come across many homeless people and also drug addicts congregating together. On two occasions we witnessed young men 'shooting up'. I know this happens in every city and I am a frequent visitor to my own capital city, but this seemed excessive.

Sad,,"People seem to love Vancouver, and it does have some redeeming features but the downtown is on the whole a depressing place. You can't walk with your family down the main shopping street at 10am without being confronted by addicts, people just smoking pot, homeless etc. All major cities have these elements in contained parts, but in Vancouver you just can't escape it no matter what neighbourhood you're in. Stanley Park is obviously impressive but it seems that all the open space was taken and put in one location rather than distributed across the city, leaving very little relief from the urban areas. I liked Yaletown best with great restaurants. Gastown was good as well, with trendy shops and restaurants but is darker and rougher. The main downtown is absent of historic buildings or nice contemporary ones. The overall retail offering is very poor. All in all I felt there was little going for Vancouver downtown other than its walkability and ease of getting around.","April 30, 2017",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 17:47:18.973620,2021-06-18 17:47:19.051727

Vancouver (Gas Town),,"Short weekend getaway in mid April1. Stayed at an Airbnb - Gastown part of Vancouver.   Low price and very accommodating.2. YVR airport to downtown Vancouver.  Buy a compass card at the transit machine.  You can't miss it, right before boarding the train.  Runs pretty frequently as we arrived around 10pm. Map it out ahead of time so you know when to get off.3. Gastown - I would compare it to part of a city. i.e. (Old city Philadelphia,  Lower East Side NYC.).Morning- has a tourist/local mix atmosphere.  Family and mix of age groups.  Evening- more young adults out and about heading to bars/restaurants. Lots of homeless people around and more noticeable because of less foot traffic compared to the busier cities mentioned above.Great eatery spots - definitely yelp the area.  Lots of great spots. 4. Public transportation - the compass card is great and handy to use on bus or train.  Definitely load it up if you plan to travel around the city often in a day. The bus comes very frequently as well and gets you to any spot you need to go.  Didn't rent a car but driving looks easy too.5. Sightseeing - we picked the most obvious spots. Stanley Park,  Capilano suspension bridge, VanDusen Botanical Garden and Granville Island Market.  All spots were worth the trip.Stanley Park - do the bike ride around the park.Capilano bridge - great views but try to go in the morning to avoid crowds.Granville Market - like a Reading terminal in Philadelphia or Chelsea markets in NyC. Still great choices of food stalls.","April 26, 2017",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 17:47:31.894880,2021-06-18 17:47:31.976320

World Class City,,"Vancouver's urban planners get global attention for buildings and the innovation of mixed usage zoning. Here people work, dwell and play.

The Vancouver Art Gallery is surrounded by coffee shops; also take in the Pendulum Gallery (a good place to pause and eat); a few blocks away is the Contemporary Art Gallery, and nearby some fun places to eat or just a sit-down in Emery Barnes Park.

Cosmopolitan yet compact.,,"Great shopping district. Stores appear separated at street level but most stores are connected through an underground concourse mall and huge parking garage.

The walkable city,,"Downtown vancouver is the best city to visit as a tourist? Why? You can walk the city. That is, when it is not raining cats and dogs. But that's not everyday. From your cruise ship which docks at the city centre ( the only one I think with a city this size that has cruise ships dock at city centre) you can walk the city. Yes the downtown city core. To your left is the famous gastown, the old city of vancouver which was burned. It maintains its old classic atmosphere with brick roads and quaint shops and eateries. You won't go hungry. At 12 noon you will hear the old clock. Time to eat, that is. To your right as you leave the cruise ship, you can find a huge convention centre and the further up is the Olympic cauldron. Remember Vancouver was the site of the Winter Olympics that featured its sister-city up North, Whistler, famous for its ski resorts and now, triathlon. Go strength is a combination of office and residential buildings. What makes Vancouver vibrant is that it is alive after office hours because many office people live downtown. Therefore, many restaurants are open in the evening. Unlike other cities where office people live out of town and therefore the city is like a ghost town after office. In those cities, you will be hard pressed to find a MacDonalds open at night. One can do a hop on and off tour. Or simply walk the city core for exercise and taste the food at every block. That would be fun!  Enjoy the Vancouver, voted yearly in the top 5 best city in the world.","November 15, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:51:04.784547,2021-06-18 17:51:04.868485

Not what you think!,,"I had heard that Vancouver was one of the most beautiful cities in the world so I was very excited to finally be able to visit. It was our embarkation point on a cruise to Alaska. The taxi ride from the airport was long & boring. Nothing particularly special. When we crossed the bridge & entered the downtown area I was surprised to find the buildings not so modern nor architecturally interesting. Blah & dirty. Our hotel was located across from the sports arena & other than that, not much of anything else. Walked to Chinatown just to be disappointed. No good restaurants or shopping. No comparison to San Fran, New York, London, Philly, etc.... Next stop, Yaletown. Walking from Chinatown to this area was safe but a little unsettling. The streets are filled with homeless people, garbage & very trashy. Frankly, I just didn't expect that. Yaletown was cool but a very small section of downtown Vancouver. All in all, Vancouver didn't live up to its reputation (at least the downtown area).","November 11, 2016",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 17:51:19.956697,2021-06-18 17:51:20.038829

One Of My Favorite Cities For Beautiful Views Excellent Restaurants & More,,"My daughter & I took  the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. Then, we took a city bus to downtown Vancouver. We literally walked right on to the bus when we got off the ferry. How wonderfully convenient! We were headed to the Playhouse Theater for a matinee performance. The last stop the bus made was right across the street from the theater! What a great transportation system. It was much more convenient than taking a car & having to deal with traffic & parking. Not to mention the cost of taking a car on the ferry. After the performance, we had enough time to walk through the downtown area before heading to the waterfront to catch a seaplane home. We loved the vibe of the downtown with its shops, department stores, restaurants, hotels, beautiful mountain & water views.

What to do in Vancouver,,"Vancouver is a beautiful city...when it's not rainy and gloomy. The city itself is smaller than most major metro's around the world but there's still plenty to do. For restaurants and bars check out Yaletown; this small section of the city has great restaurants from mainstream food to chic and elegant spots including lounges. From Yaletown you can go and explore Granville St. which is the club district. It's lined by nightclubs and restaurants, the street however does get rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights. It's fairly safe with a lot of police presence but if you don't want to deal with drunks I would say away.Near Granville St. is Robson St. which lined by shops. Robson St. has lost some of it's past glory and isn't what it was 10 years ago as a lot of shops have closed down or moved to malls but it still worth checking out. Also on Robson St. is Pacific Centre mall. The mall went through a massive reno last year which included the opening of Nordstorms and other shops. If you want to buy high end luxury stuff you can check out Holt Renfrew which also went through a major reno this past summer and includes the first full Chanel store in Canada.Speaking of high end stores...you can also check out Alberni St. which is on the rear of the Shanghai-La hotel. This street has some high end retailers such as Prada, Burberry and Versace. It also have a few of the best restaurants in the city where a lot of locals and celebs. English Bay is a nice during hot summer nights, the views are amazing and you can catch yourself a nice sunset. Stanley Park and Lions Gate bridge are your typical must see places for Tourist. You can also walk the seawall from the Bayshore Hotel to Pan Pacific which is nice walk, not overly crowded and you get amazing water views. Las the but not least is Gastown. This area has gone through a lot of changes and more chic, hipster restaurants have opened up. The area is fairly safe but I would not recommend wandering around too much because it is surrounded by the Vancouver east side which littered with the homeless and drug addicts.","October 26, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:51:48.715852,2021-06-18 17:51:48.792623

Stanley park (thank goodness they can't build there) and Granville island were nice. I tried to find a concert or theatre but without luck, except for PAL which was brilliant.

Liveable City? Hmmmm,,"OK this is about a Downtown area of a major City. Its not about the suburbs, nor the surrounding regions.And to be fair, we only felt unsafe once.That said Vancouver has a huge problem. Homeless people literally clog the streets. Virtually every door way, every vent from the subway system and more are filled nightly. Begging is on the rise, though it is polite and when declined they move away swiftly.Avoid Chinatown - we inadvetantly, in the middle of the day, wandered into the area - attracted by the Vancouver highlights on TV. Mistake. Absolutely clogged with homeless and we did not feel safe at all. We finally escaped to Gastown but were not happy at the experience.Homeless people are homeless for a number of reasons, however we couldn't help but feel that whatever the cause the City of Vancouver was abandoning these unfortunate people, only one local church to where we were staying appeared to be doing anything to assist.We decided that what these unfortunate people needed was not money but food and clothing. Our choice. But imagine our surprise when 'doing the right thing' via aforesaid church was almost rejected out of hand...Did this impact on our enjoyment of Vancouver as a 'destination'? Unfortunately yes. The worst aspect was the apparent lack of any effort to help the (we were told) over 70,000 homeless in the City.It's a problem - it will get worse and Vancouver City elders should be doing more.

I feel safe in most parts of Downtown Vancouver, but you need to educate yourself if you're going to be walking around by yourself...avoid the Downtown East side i.e. the few blocks around East Hastings where the homeless people with addiction and mental health issues congregate. Adjacent Chinatown also gets it's share of these types.  Although I feel safe walking to Chinatown with a friend during the day, at night I would take a cab if I were visiting a restaurant there.  I also find the south end of Granville Street, right as you enter Downtown Vancouver from the Granville Street Bridge, to be a little seedy as well.  Again, not a problem during the day, but at night, I would think twice about walking there alone.  Otherwise, I feel that Downtown Vancouver is a safe and beautiful place to explore.  Not much to do for kids though, best to take them to areas outside of the downtown area.","October 19, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:52:06.259938,2021-06-18 17:52:06.337212

Car hire,,Arrived In Vancouver airport after long tiring flight expecting to have a fight on my hands to upgrade car hire due to the fact that in U.K. Neither Holliday company nor enterprise could sort out A large SUV. we are a family of 5 and believe me when I say despite what your tour operator tells you you won't fit 5 people 5 suitcases and associated hand luggage into a standard SUV and if you like us are going to do 2000km round national parks and mountain DON'T  take a mini van you will get stuck. So we arrive at the Alamo/enterprise desk and very briefly explain our problem and WOW the young man could not have been more helpful he agreed that we would need 4wd because of the route we are taking and promptly handed us the keys to a brand new GMC Yukon. (6km on clock)Don't get me wrong this upgrade cost a lot of money do not be under the impression that this came easy we are talking an extra £480 for 2 weeks on top of the £650 already paid in the U.K. Ok we opted for the zero excess that was 5 Canadian dollars a day and there was a couple of other things to pay the actual cost for the car was 35 cd a day extra but for us it's worth it comfort and room the truck is beautiful I won't want to go back to my SUV at home.

Seymour, Horseshoe Bay, Deep Cove, Shaughnessy, and lately the East end around the foot of Main all the way south to Marine Drive.  Oh and Point Grey and Burnaby Mountain each with a university campus. Really, hard to find another city its equal. Now driving has become something of a zoo and the city is a very expensive place to visit, let alone in which to live, but it's certainly worth the trip.","October 16, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 17:52:22.442366,2021-06-18 17:52:22.517645

In surprise in all honesty.The reason why I don't give it a 5 out of 5 it's because the lack of police in the street.I understand this is a safe city and all but it would be nice to see a cop here and there in case you get lost you know.Overall great city very safe.By the way another reason I gave it 4/5 it's because the food is way high again it's to be expected specially in a downtown area.,"October 15, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:52:35.268151,2021-06-18 17:52:35.344469

Loved Vancouver Downtown,,"Arriving by cruise ship, Vancouver looks like a jewel in a beautiful setting.  We loved downtown.  We stayed right in the heart of it off Burrard and Robson.  We could easily walk everywhere we wanted to go and didn't feel unsafe or threatened - Gastown, Chinatown, (don't go to Main St.) Granville Island, easy access to Stanley Park and the beaches, water views and sunsets,  great Metro system, and Canada Place for free busses to other places.  Lots of great food places, we're not big shoppers but there was plenty of that.  The people were friendly and most helpful.   Prices are high, but after coming back from Alaska, that wasn't a culture shock.  The only thing a bit disconcerting were the number of beggars on every street - usually holding signs stating medical issues.

Something for Everyone,,"My husband and I loved riding the open-air tour bus all over downtown Vancouver. It is a hop on/hop off ride, with tickets good for all day. We were able to see many sections of downtown Vancouver, visit the waterfront, stop to eat and shop for eclectic souvenirs, then hop back on the bus. Vancouver is a beautiful city, and the shopping is great! I have visited here several times. Love it. We stayed at the Four Seasons which was a very central location for exploring the city.

"Beautiful downtown, some areas need work",,"We really enjoyed walking around downtown Vancouver.  Downtown Vancouver is a beautiful mix of new glass and steel modern high rise design and stately old brick architecture.  Unlike many cities, Vancouver's downtown streets have several landscaped courtyards between buildings that allow pedestrians to move from one street through to he next one over without having to walk entire blocks .  One area near the harbor had a beautiful stepping stone walkway through a water feature stream that turned out to be (to our utter delight) the tip of an underground parking garage!  The city has done a great job of using plants and trees and dedicated pockets of green space to make the downtown pretty.  Good bike lanes coexist with wide streets in many areas.  Some places seemed a little trashed out... As if no one had picked up the trash in a while and unfortunately it seemed that people chose to just throw trash in he ground rather than find receptacles for it.  There are a lot of restaurants and coffee shops and if you don't mind being around a lot of people or tourists, this is one of the finest downtowns around.","August 28, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:56:12.944610,2021-06-18 17:56:13.030075

There's so much one can do on any day; but shopping is also a delight. I realize reviewing a chain store is odd; but a trip to/through Nordstrom's is a treat. The products are standard fare for the store (top end, etc) but what made it remarkable for me were the employees. Each person I encountered was down-to-earth; fun; interesting; and seemed to really enjoy their work.  Two fellows in the Vans area were absolutely delightful; going way beyond in terms of service.

Vancouver -- developers gone wild,,"We stayed downtown for two days and nights -- first visit.  The city is going through what seems like a messy metamorphosis -- construction is everywhere with cranes and highrises popping up faster than weeds in an abandoned school yard.  Stanley Park can be beautiful, but it is oh sooo crowded and NOISY!  There are commercial planes flying overhead taking tourists on aerial tours of the city, and they seem to frequent the area over the less crowded parts of Stanley Park.  The perimeter, which is a source of great local pride, is incredibly crowded and not at all relaxing unless you get there by 8 a.m.  One of the main roads leading to a key bridge goes right through the center of the park and it sends car noise quite a distance.  I would take Central Park in NYC or numerous parks in Britain or Golden Gate Park over Stanley Park any day.Our hotel had terrific staff and lovely service -- very clean and nice rooms, but even though on the 9th floor on the street side that was ""less noisy"" it was quite noisy.  We kept the air conditioning on high all night to drown out the noise.Do NOT waste your time going across that bridge to the tourist trap of the Capilano suspension bridge!  They charge $40 (Canadian) per person, and it is not connected to a major park where you can hike.  You are limited to walking around with thousands of other equally clueless tourists on raised wooden walkways from one wooden view station to another.  If you absolutely MUST go, arrive at the opening bell!There are some cute areas in Vancouver, great restaurants, and fantastic people.  Loved all the Canadiens we met and interacted with. Incredibly friendly and helpful.  Tons of high end shopping as well, although it is spread all over the place helter skelter.  City needs to have some major urban planning take place -- it's a shame how little infrastructure there is (traffic is TERRIBLE -- airport in inconvenient location.  If you are returning to Vancouver from anywhere else, you pretty much have to go through a good part of Vancouver to get to the airport and the roads are small, clogged -- literally no major freeways.","August 24, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 17:56:27.302167,2021-06-18 17:56:27.380128

Happily true,,"All the cliches I'd heard about Canadians seemed to be true. The city had a beauty that was a match for Paris in its symmetry and a youthful vibe.  New construction and sleek class skyscrapers set off 19th century two story structures that came across as warm and funky. The harbor areas were warmly lit by the sun and the city planners did a great job weaving a complex mix of travel related open spaces and polished store fronts. Shopping leaned towards luxury stores and boutique clothing. Restaurants ranged from mom and pop ethnic to upscale gourmet. As a New Yorker I was struck by how clean the city was, how polite the pedestrians were to each other and the traffic, and the fact that there seemed to large numbers of young, fit people moving around the city's streets at all hour.

You have downtown with all the buildings, shops and restaurants and the wonderful Stanley Park with its beaches, sea wall and walks and then not too far away Grouse Mountain and Kitsilano areas. You can go further afield to Whistler or Vancouver island, take loads of different boat trips whale watching or to different destinations.

The downtown area has many magnetic neighborhoods and restaurants, with glassy apartment buildings that will excite or bore you depending on your taste. Culture is not as exciting as New York, Chicago or even LA, but you can't have everything. Shoreline parks such as Jericho Beach, Kitsilano, Spanish Banks, will make you want to live here (but check your bank account). SunYat Sen garden will inspire. There used to be endless cheap ethnic restaurants in town but these, while still present, have succumbed to the urbanization and wealth. Granville Island is great fun and is fun to walk around and see the market and so many shops. This is a great town, lots of fun. Maybe losing its soul like Seattle, but filled with things to do and always that beautiful setting.","July 26, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 17:59:34.435613,2021-06-18 17:59:34.516932

Walkers Rejoice,,"Vancouver Downtown is made for walking. And this place is walkable all year round. The streets are very well treed and the city takes pride in landscaping. The recent addition of bike lanes on streets such as Hornby has made walking around even more pleasurable. There is a great diversity of buildings with a good mix of heritage and glass. There are multiple focal points--Georgia and Granville and around Vancouver Art Gallery--where you can see people of all ages in transit. You can shop at Nordstrom, Hudson's Bay or get chocolates or other necessities at London Drugs or Shoppers Drugmart. There are many eating options catering to every budget and preferences. To take a break from the bustle, seek out hidden gardens such as the one at the BC law court complex and the one outside of Bill Reid's West Coast Art Gallery. Of course there is always the waterfront with spectacular scenery and abundance of seating for rest and people watching.

And I kept calling the number to make a complain but no one picked up the phone!I have seen the astonishing number of homeless people in downtown Vancouver. I don't know who is responsible or what is the politics behind, but it was really sad to see. It takes a lot of time to go anywhere around and parking is a huge problem. Then there are tourist bus parking everywhere. And thousands of tourists come out of those buses and start taking selfie middle of no where. I wish there was better public transport and less traffic to see this beautiful city.","July 13, 2016",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 18:00:49.708565,2021-06-18 18:00:49.784481
I love Vancouver!!,,"We try to spend time in Vancouver at least four or five times a year. It is a beautiful city. I love walking the streets and exploring. There is lots to see and lots to do. Stanley Park has so much to offer including walking the seawall. The waterfront is gorgeous and Granville Island is always a great experience. On a nice day taking the water taxis gives you a new way of seeing the city and getting around. If you have time, you can head up to Grouse Mountain and take in the views of the city and surrounding area. We also try to take advantage of the many types of food available in a wide range of restaurants and if you want to stay outside, you have the food trucks. Then there is the hop on hop off busses, the theatre, the concerts, the special events ... Even if you are a local, you should go and discover what the city has to offer. I think you will be pleased.","July 13, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:00:49.784486,2021-06-18 18:00:49.862896

Mayor Moonbeam Vision of a City,,"Unfortunately for tourists they will not meet a great cross section of Vancouverites in downtown Vancouver. Our infamous Mayor Robertson has made downtown bicycle friendly while sacrificing space for cars. Most streets you can't turn on and you need to go into your line of credit to park whether on or off the street.Vancouverites that don't live downtown, only go there if they have to. Some go to work, some go to get a passport renewed. Most don't go. There is very good shopping. Stores you won't find anywhere else. Everything downtown is geared to the tourist. i.e., You will pay more than anywhere else in town Expensive restaurants, too many panhandlers.If you want to see the city, head over the bridges to South Granville, Main Street, 4th Avenue, Pt.

Travel round the town was easy by the local buses and trains. Street theatre in the heart of the downtown near the university. A good selection of shops as far as I could see, though sightseeing rather than shopping was my main focus.

What I covered in 1 day,,"Tips:- Skytrain from YVR airport goes directly to downtown- Skytrain Pacific Center station is a mall, with lots of stores and a food court, a good starting point if you're not driving and thinking of shopping- Skytrain Waterfront station is a good starting point if you want to sight see (Canada place, Gas town)- Skytrain Yaletown Roundhouse is near False Creek where an aquabus can take you to Granville island (highly recommended), there are also bike rental shops here.- Gastown has the iconic Steam clock. The shops here usually sell artsy stuff. For tourists, there are cheap souvenir shops here.- Further down the road from Canada place is the Olympic torch and the Lego like whale sculpture. This place offers a great views. (Bring a sweater could get very windy)- I've seen some hop on hop off buses near Canada place and shuttles going to Whistler, don't know the prices though- There are cheap parking spaces, most impark lots have pretty reasonable rates.- Robson street and near it, is where most shopping stores are located at- East Hastings is where most of the homeless are (druggies are here, as i've been told)Pros:- Very accessible by Skytrain even from the YVR airport it all depends on what activity you want to do first- Very walkable city- Nice views especially near Canada place Waterfront area- Quiet compared to other Big city downtowns- unusually few cars but then again Skytrain gets you here rather quickly- it is common to see tourists holding cameras taking pictures, locals don't seem to mind- the sea breeze is very nice, i did a lot of deep breathing while near the waterCons:- Prices of items are more expensive if you compare them to United States- You get occassional homeless weirdos, I experienced one splashing water on my windshield then wiping it at a stoplight asking for cash.Although Vancouver downtown is great, I must say I still like Victoria more, it felt more safe and relaxed.

My husband and I spent quite a few hours just relaxing on a shaded bench, watching the world go by and the sea planes coming and going. Unfortunately, and the reason for the 'but' in my review title, is that Vancouver has a bad problem with 'drop outs'.  I have tried to find a polite way to describe them, because I am sure for some of them it isn't a life style choice.  Sadly you get the feeling that drugs are a problem.  We were approached on quite a few occasions by someone begging, preaching or just shouting abuse.  No matter what, I would say you should visit Vancouver, just be sensible and aware.  I bought a handbag that went acorss my body while I was there, as I was worried about having my normal one snatched, a problem that even gets a warning on the UK Government travel website.","July 5, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:01:48.619134,2021-06-18 18:01:48.695177

I think your mayor should consider our aging population and do something about this one of few flaws in this beautiful city.","June 18, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:03:26.955085,2021-06-18 18:03:27.031454
"Easy to navigate, modern/historic, walkable, restuarants, beautiful bay and views. Love this town.",,"Downtown Vancouver was easy to access from the airport - we took the Skytrain.  Once downtown we walked a few blocks to our hotel.  Another three blocks down the hill was the waterfront.  We only a day and  half here - bit it is easily one of my favorite place to visit now.  There is so much more to do in and around the area. Most of this downtown is small enough to walk (if you are a mobile person) and it easy to navigate. There are several restaurants on the waterfront streets and several more at hotels. There is a small underground 'shopping mall' area that features Purdy's Chocolates (YUM), a drugstore, gem/rocks/jewelry stores and more.  There is also a small grocery downtown and a liquor store if  you want a bottle of wine or Prosecco to enjoy later at your hotel for a special celebration. Prices were comparable to U.S.  even for a downtown location - within a few dollars pending the brand. I was surprised to learn that Vancouver is the second largest port in North America. The skyline is really historic and modern at the same time. You can enjoy watching seaplanes (commuter planes) take off and land all day long from the waterfront area.  The view of the mountains and bay was breathtaking. We felt safe strolling the downtown area during the day and through the evening. It was still dusk at 9 p.m. in May. This is a beautiful city with a great deal to offer. Downtown Vancouver does have several districts and we were in the business and gaslight district when walking.  Some other areas farther away may not be as tourist friendly- not sure.  We took advantage of the Hop on Hop off Trolley to visit the sights and picked it up at hour hotel.  Travelled to Stanley Park for several hours, Granville Island, and all other downtown districts - including Chinatown. We had planned to eat dinner there - but were disappointed at the appearance of the area and decided not to get off there. We did visit Vancouver Urban Winery - that is a good stop to be sure.","June 17, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:03:27.031460,2021-06-18 18:03:27.108680

Mixed Review,,"Like most cities there is good and bad. There are a lot of aged hippies who appear homeless. There are a large number is pan-handlers and mentally ill wandering the streets and approaching you. It helps to know which neighborhoods to avoid because of their unsavory character. Vancouver is a very new city mainly erected since 1986. There is a rather unimaginative, monotonous skyline dominated by green glass boxy high rises which lack character. Fortunately they have saved a few elegant early 20th century building which remain timeless. We really enjoyed Stanley Park, Flyover Canada at Canada Place, the panoramic view from Vancouver Lookout and the beautiful Marine Office Building (1930's) built back when architects had real talent!

Best place n the world to live.......,,"......or so they say though a friend who has lived there and in Cape Town rates Cape Town better.  He likes the heat, I prefer a colder climate!  Vancouver is a marvelously cosmopolitan city with unsurprisingly a high Asian element and, more surprisingly many from the sub-Continent (possibly because of Empire?). As a result the range of food on offer is very extensive (almost as good as Brighton!).

You aren't going to find much that is unique to Vancouver because you can't see the water and you can't see the mountains; if you could it would be unique in Canada but Vancouver's downtown is not unique.  It's also not very old.  The city was only established in 1886 although it grew very fast after that.  So don't look for history.

Gastown is the exception to my poor rating.,,"We thought that downtown Vancouver was scruffy, soulless and ugly. They seem to have a policy of eradicating any buildings that are older than 30 years and then build a huge glass fronted skyscraper in it's place. Apart from Gastown, which was our favourite place, there is no character or soul left in Vancouver. Indeed, the number of beggars and homeless people on the streets was quite shocking to be honest, and if you stray up towards Chinatown or thereabouts, then leave quickly...it is very dodgy at night.

Attractive modern downtown- but mostly closed on Sunday,,"We arrived at the central Canada Place cruise port which is one part of a larger pier which includes the Pan Pacific Hotel, the Convention Center, and an Imax theatre with a Canadian tourist film. Baggage storage, taxis, bus connections and the Sky Train rail service are all nearby. Note that the very helpful and useful Vancouver Tourist Information office is across the street, NOT the highly visible small kiosks which only sell hop-on/ hop off bus services but know little about anything else. There is free wifi at the tourist office and the staff was very helpful. We walked a lot of downtown, but since we disembarked at 9 am there were few places open. Gastown is the old original area of Vancouver, with 1890s buildings now housing shops and restaurants. Probably interesting when everything is lively, however we were in port on a Sunday morning when nothing is open. It is walkable from Canada Place cruise port, about half a mile. This area and nearby Chinatown  were notable for what seems to be a policy of homeless men permitted to sleep in parks and on the street, which offset the charm.Robson Street is the trendy shopping center of Vancouver, with both local and international chain stores. It was full of activity on a Sunday, and the only place we could find a money exchange shop on Sunday ( at 1169 Robson).The central area of large banks and office towers would be active at other times but there is nothing to see on a Sunday.","May 29, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:05:20.259183,2021-06-18 18:05:20.336155

A friendly and beautiful city with a dark side,,"My husband was last in Vancouver nearly forty years ago and was keen to return to what he remembers as a beautiful city. And it didn't disappoint in so many ways. We stayed in a hotel on Robson street and were able to walk easily to all the main attractions. We particularly enjoyed Granville Island market and the fantastic food available. Check out the delicious Indian cuisine and sip a beer at the brewery. We hired bikes and cycled around Stanley park and continued along the sea wall for miles. The city is very cycle friendly and it is a great way to get around. Eating out was always good and very reasonably priced. A boat trip around the many islands in search of whales was great fun. Sadly the whales didn't grace us with their presence! I would also recommend the art gallery and Chinese gardens.I don't like to put a downer on all this positivity but Vancouver has a serious problem with drugs and people sleeping on the streets. Most of the time, it was in small numbers but on one occasion we managed to venture into an area between Gas Town and China Town (East Hastings Street) which can only be described as a horror story. Large groups of drug addicts were lining the alleyways and walking vacantly around the streets and the stench of urine was overpowering. It was an intimidating experience and we had no warning that certain areas should be avoided. I have visited many cities in the world but none with such a big problem. It is almost as if the authorities are closing their eyes and hoping it will all go away.

Downtown 'on the shoulder',,"Vancouver is a delightful area, clean and easy to get around.  Like most big cities, the heart is small in area relatively speaking but to know where to go, it's best to get orientated.  The first thing one needs to is take the bus tours around the city to get the geography and the history of the place.  The walk and walk.  We do it 'on the shoulder' usually at the end of winter into spring.  Weather can be problematic but there is no bad weather just badly prepared clothes !!!  The bars are great, people friendly and everything is accessible by foot.  On the shoulder traffic downtown is less congested but taxi drivers usually know the best way about if you need them.  Other than that the bus has a 'hop on hop off' ticket pricing which allows the flexibility to see most sites and areas over a couple of days.  Vancouver deserves about 3 days if it's a quick trip but equally it is a good base to get out to the whole area.","May 26, 2016",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:05:20.726170,2021-06-18 18:05:20.803234

safe and walkable everywhere,,"I have lived all over the world, including ""dangerous"" third world countries, so I am seasoned to walking around downtown cores.

However, they are not aggressive and don't carry weapons.  They congregate in clumps for their own safety, and are sad cases.  If you don't want to be subjected to panhandling or the evidence that drug dealers are in fact slavers,  just move over to a parallel street.  The ""sad"" streets are limited to a few isolated blocks in Gastown, and I won't go into the politics of the drug trade, but don't be afraid to walk anywhere at all in Vancouver.

What IS that smell?,,"I don't understand what the smell was. It just seemed that as we would walk around a smell of garbage would suddenly creep up. The place wasn't as nice as I would've thought. There are a ton of homeless people walking around. One pair bombarded us as we were eating and when we told them we didn't have any physical money on us they got frustrated and left. Then we bumped into them an hour later down some blocks away. Talk about a stare down and an awkward walk through downtown. Another time, some lady kept mumbling to herself along the sidewalk as I passed (somewhat far just in case) she began to follow me and at one point got so close I thought she was going to either lean on me or take my purse. I stopped walking suddenly and she, i guess expected me to be there, almost fell against the wall, looked back at me and then walked away. It was a strange walkabout in downtown Vancouver. In the, i guess, nicer areas it was less populated by the homeless but still not as pleasant as I hoped.","April 30, 2016",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:06:58.066559,2021-06-18 18:06:58.149130

A unique and amazing city,,"I spent a day in Vancouver recently.  I took that scenic Amtrak Cascades train up from Seattle.Living in Seattle as I have for 50 years I have visited Vancouver several times.I have seen the city grow and change.  Used to be that if you were going to visit British Columbia...Victoria was always the first choice and Vancouver...was.... well ...a big city that didn't have the charm of the Empress Hotel,  Butchart Gardens, the parliament buildings and that statue of Queen Victoria. I have been on a couple of cruises recently where Victoria was one of the ports of call and I have to say that it was nice to be there but it was, in comparison to Vancouver, rather..how should I say this...limited..yes limited in flat out awesomeness not to mention great restaurants, places to go, stuff to see, and things to do. Vancouver reminds me an awful lot of New York City and San Francisco in that it has what I refer to as ""the just being there"" wow factor.  Yet NYC and San Francisco do not in any way compare with the magnificent natural sea and mountain setting for this world class city. I had spent the afternoon on the my favorite street...Robson..and was now walking down Thurlow on this April day. I could see the harbor and rising above it snow capped mountains. And the those peaks were not that far away!It's an incredibly beautiful city of many parks the  likes of English Bay and Stanley Park with seascapes, and harbor and mountains and lush greenery. At the same time it is sophisticated and cosmopolitan.I see where Vancouver has been deemed ""the most liveable city in the world"" by some organization.  I have no issue with that.I live in Seattle which is a lovely Pacific Northwest city.

Its better to just spend half day at each area instead of trying to cram everything into one day. It could be exhausting trying to do too much in one day.

His best tip was that we should buy a Day Pass for the public transportation, which also is good for the SeaBus (and I think the SkyTrain, though we didn't use that).  It was so nice not to have to worry about exact Canadian change for each bus we hopped on.  It also saved a ton in parking fees, had we tried to drive to the places we wanted to go.  Vancouver is such a friendly, interesting and exciting place to visit!","March 31, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:08:04.375466,2021-06-18 18:08:04.458556

West of Main are fabulous high end malls and upscale Robson Street shopping, the main art gallery, convention centres on the water - lots you can explore on foot or bus.  For a small fare you can take the sea us to the North Shore and see it all from the other side or keep walking west and hit Stanley Park for free.  Go south to see hip Yaletown.  The best fusion food anywhere.","February 24, 2016",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:09:10.312646,2021-06-18 18:09:10.391201

Fun to see the sights!,,"I enjoy traveling downtown by Skytrain. It only takes 20 minutes from where I live. I usually exit at either Granville Station or Waterfont. Since the Canada Line was built, it's fun to get a cup of coffee and observe the tourists coming and going with their suitcases. I love walking down Cordova Street to Gastown, or up to Hastings or up Seymour. There are many unique book stores and interesting shops which are still left if you're not into mall shopping. It's also fun to walk along the scenic waterfront near Canada Place. A new walkway was finished recently and connects to Stanley Park. It takes 45 minutes to one hour to walk to Stanley Park. There are many coffee shops and delicious restaurants downtown.

I'm of two minds on this,,"I've been coming to Vancouver at least once a year - sometimes twice or three times - since the early 80s.  The shopping is still as good as ever if you don't mind all the American clothing stores and Asian cuisine that's moving into downtown now.  For me this is the disappointing part.  In the early 80s on Robson Street, there were a lot of individual shopkeepers who were locally based and unattached to large American chains.  There were also a lot more European restaurants.  Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against a good Chinese or Japanese meal.  There are times when I'd like a good old fashioned steak and potatoes restaurant that I can go to.  Robson Street has also lost some of its charm when the small locally owned businesses left.By the way, the visit was with family (teens), family (no kids), and friends.  We were there for a week last June and who was with us depended on the day.  Our December trip was mostly family with teens.  A three hour visit is about right, unless you decide to include lunch with your visit.

I liked the walk from Canada Place to Stanley Park, there are a lot of cafés and you can go for a cruise on one of the boats there, too (even fly around). On the other hand, compared to Seattle the Downtown seemed to me a bit busier and less comfortable, but it is true that I spent in Vancouver just a weekend, so my opinion may be influenced with the rush to see as much as possible in a short time.","December 19, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:11:04.894078,2021-06-18 18:11:04.979995

City with a View,,"I have hasd the pleasure to work and live in this beautiful city. Vancouver is easily accessible from the airport via sky train. You cannot get lost because there is only 1 train going 1 direction. It will take about 25 minutes to get to Granville Station. This is the Hearst of the downtown area. You are in waslking distance to Robson street lined with boutique shops and restaurants. You can a also take a quick 10 minute walk to the famous Gastown where you can find many souvenirs and restaurants. It is quite nice there because of the cobblestone streets and lampposts. On the way stop by the Pan Pacific for a spectacular water and mountain view. You can also ride the Seabus next door for under $3 by a short 10 minute ride across the water to a market called Lonsdale Quay. When you get back, ask for directions to either take a 15 minute walk r 5 minute taxi ride to China town. We have a very large Chinese population and you will see shops, etc all in Chinese. If you want to go to Granville Island, which is a beautiful market right on the ocean, you will need to take a taxi or a bus. It is about 5miles from downtown. It is a beautiful city that you will need about 3-5 days to see all its beauty. I haven't even touched on the Capilano Suspension bridge or our famous Vancouver Canucks sports teams!

North America’s version of Hong Kong,,"With the sea on one side, towering mountains on the other, and a multitude of skyscrapers nestled between, this cosmopolitan city reminds me of Hong Kong. Stanley Park, established in 1888, is walking distance from Downtown, and can be compared to New York’s Central Park—only there are 1,001 acres, compared to Central Park’s 843. Take a stroll along Vancouver Seawall/English Bay, comparable to San Francisco’s Embarcadero, and Gastown—the original settlement—is like Frisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf District. A water taxi will take you to Granville Island, a shopper’s paradise. And there’s a shuttle bus to Grouse Mountain, and the infamous Grouse Grind (a tortuous hike up the rugged mountain)☺ Canada Place has iconic sail-like features reminiscent of Sydney Opera House. Robson Street is Beverly Hills’ version of Rodeo Drive. There are oodles of restaurants, hotels, shops, museums. North America’s second largest Chinatown surrounds Main Street—but beware: lack of new construction has attracted a large homeless population and drug addicts, much like areas of San Francisco. Walking along the cosmopolitan streets for hours made me relish the daily 90-minute massages I got for CAD$90 (US$68). Foodies have international selections, everything from sushi to fish ’n’ chips. On Granville Street, I had Salmon Alfredo (yum!), a pleasant take on the mundane Chicken Alfredo. Anything you could possibly want is offered in vivacious Vancouver.

Easy to walk round.,,"Compact and easy to navigate, Vancouver is a safe and pleasant place to visit. Don't bother with the buses unless you really need to, as they are nowhere near as frequent as in, say, London, and you may spend a lot of time waiting at stops instead of seeing the sights.Beware of rushing to buy a day pass for the hop on/ hop off tourist buses or trolleys as they are heavily discounted on sites such as Viator. Hiring bikes is a great way to see Stanley Park and the waterfront areas as the fantastic sea wall has wide, designated, safe cycle ways all the way round. Similarly, the pedestrian lanes are flat and scenic, but it would be a long walk to see the delights of Stanley Park. Use the tiny False Creek ferries to visit Garnville Island for a few hours but for most of downtown Vancouver you'll be fine on foot.

Here we noticed street people and garbage everywhere and it was not a pretty site, I could not believe that the city would allow this. We later learned that this is a normal thing and that it is only in that area. Wen we toured around we noticed that this was a completely different place in the morning as everything was cleaned up.

If it's a short stay and your ability to tour around is limited you're gonna be fine downtown. However, be sure to walk beyond Robson Street and Granville Street.

"Like Any Other Northern American City, Nothing special",,"We lived one block away from Robson street, which is the shopping center of Vancouver. The street is lined with brand-name shops, same as Rodeo Drive in LA. The only thing that people from LA, like us, would feel interested in is the Roots apparel store, and Aritzia fashion store. They do have some good designs in the store. If you have to do some shopping in Vancouver, those are the 2 stores I would recommend. When in Vancouver, ice wine is their specialty, at least try one bottle. It is really sweet, not my type of wine. I heard about Vancouver's food were really good before going there, especially seafood. We didn't have the pleasure to enjoy a lot of seafood, but ordered a dozen of Oysters while in Sutton Hotel restaurant. For some reason, they are the worst oysters I've ever had. They are small and expensive, $4 a piece, OMG, I must be really in vacation mood to spend that kind of money for sub-par seafood. However, Asian food are superb and authentic, no wonder it is the heaven for Asian foodies.There is one thing I am feeling bad about the city is the bus drivers. I have never seen any bus driver that is so rude, we were crossing the street with kids on the cross walk, and we got honked by the bus driver right by our ears.

Best way to take in Vancouver is with a good pair of sneakers!,,"The great think about Vancouver is that you really can walk everywhere.  You can start at China town, walk through Gas town (which is pretty despite the multitude of souvenir shops) and then head down Robson.  Stop and mall shop if you like, or keep trekking down the lively Robson filled with clothing shops and restaurants etc.  If you still have energy left, go all the way down to Denham and rent a bike and ride into or around Stanley Park (depending on how much time you have) and make sure you take in English Bay (at other end of Denham).  If there long enough, you can sit on a log with the many others and watch the sunset.  At this point you will likely need to cab it back to wherever you started.  If you're starving by now, head back north towards the Westin on the water and try to get a table at Cardero's Restaurant, great lively atmosphere and good eats!  Next day, be sue to take in Granville Island which you can get to by either car, or if staying downtown take a water taxi.

Must return!,,"We visited Vancouver en route to Alaska planning to stay only long enough to  recover from the long flight. Vancouver blew us away! Everything is within walking distance. And if out of town a bus ride away. Any time one stopped, some friendly local offered assistance. The public art is amazing! I even bought an inexpensive book on it at the Art Gallery! (Check out the four ships on the roof corners of the gallery). We then toured the city using this as our inspiration. It became our entre to the people of Canada. We shared  and shared. Locals even were unaware of their own cities public art. Some were showing visitors the site but were unaware of the significance. The best time was had by all. We loved the art.  We loved the people. It all worked so well, we changed our plans and returned for another three days, but even that is not enough! We will return; we must return. So much more to see and do. Oh by the way take in the Bill Reid Gallery of Native art before you do anything touristy.

The Granville Island market precinct was also very nice and is a great place for a casual meal or for buying souvenirs. In contrast, the China Town precinct was quite underwhelming compared to those my wife and I have seen in other parts of the world. One locale to be avoided is W. Hastings Street. It is a hangout for druggies and down-and-outs. Expect to get asked for money.

Nothing really sticks out,,"This city needs more pedestrian & bikes areas (it's also the case for a lot of cities) . I was expecting more of Vancouver because of all the articles stating that it's among the top 10 cities to live in, I don't know what criteria they use to say that but in my experience the city was ""meh !"". The buildings were... buildings, I'm not a fan of architecture so I might have missed the knowledge to see the beauty in it. The sea harbour is noisy and stinks of kerosene thanks to the seaplanes. Some views are spoiled by the industry on the other side.

The people were helpful and friendly.Call the tourism center before planning your trip so that you are not there when a big convention is there.  They block many of the best hotels early.  Definitely get over to the tourism center at Canada Place early on to plan out your trip.  They often offer discounts for attractions and maps and brochures.  Also, we finally figured out, after the first two days, that you don't need to buy bus and rail tickets if you have one that is less than 90 minutes old.  A couple of things that were surprising were that whenever we asked if something was organic, it usually wasn't...even at the Granville marketplace that features all local growers. And it was odd to us that we never saw a single bathroom with seat protectors either, so if that is important, I would bring those with.  All in all, very pleasurable city.  I have separately reviewed all of the attractions we did in our four and a half days.","August 19, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:18:01.261225,2021-06-18 18:18:01.341557

"Mixed Review, Mixed Impressions, But I Liked it!",,"Vancouver has to be one of the most pleasant mid-sized cities (less than 700,000) located on the Canadian West Coast province of British Columbia.

One will find the up and coming youthful generation demanding more entertainment venues and things to do. Downtown's best side is the East Side where your will fin Gastown, Chinatown and Strathcona. You will find a variety of descent restaurants, I felt fine exploring without escort. What is interesting is that Vancouver is considered ""Hollywood North"" since both Canadian and American film makers like the the venues and unfettered production and filming here.

"Vancouver, an International City that has it all!",,"When I first moved to Vancouver, they used to roll up the sidewalks at 9pm and Robson Street, was called Robsonstrasse and they sold dirndl skirts and you went there to eat shnitzle. Times have changed since Expo 86 and the 2010 Winter OIympics and other than for cost of living, Vancouver is consistently, a top global destination for tourism and for quality of life. If you are a good walker, there is little that you could not walk to in the downtown core, with our bike friendly paths, the reach extends around the jewel of downtown Vancouver, to go around Stanley Park and end up in Chinatown, Gastown, the seawall or even across False Creek to the Olympic Village and Granville Island. Americans think of themselves as being part of a melting pot. In Canada, we think of ourselves as a tossed salad. You would think you were in the halls of the United Nations with the amount of languages that you hear on our streets, we are very tolerant of LBGTQ and boast many many mixed racial families. Our burgeoning restaurant scene attests to that! If you don't find what you want in a restaurant, there is probably a food cart that serves it! Slowly but surely, Happy Hours are starting to reach Vancouver, which is honestly still burdened with some draconial liquor laws, but don't let that stop you from experiences a cocktail from Lauren Mote at UVA,   who was recently named top cocktail maker in Canada or one of the many distilleries that are popping up, or our burgeoning craft beer scene. Our diversity of nightlife reflects our varied age and ethnic makeup. Downtown is really a series of small neighborhoods and it feels just that way. (even the microclimates enhance that feeling). We even boast beaches right in the heart of downtown, I mean, how much better does it get than that?Normally, I would tell you to bring an umbrella, but these past few months have made those almost a relic. It does, however mean that in the Summer of 2015, that our eco consciousness also means that we are not using water to keep our city green in the traditional sense.

Nothing outstanding,,"For first-time visitors, it was a bit of a surprise how little the city had to offer. The transportation system is excellent - easy to use and gets you where you want to go. The views of the water and the mountains are pretty. The parks are pleasant for walking around, and lots of people were renting bicycles to take them in. The beaches were nice, if unremarkable.One problem is that the enormous number of highrise condos means there can be very little to see or do at street level. And while you can walk much of the city, you may not want to, as unpretentious shopping streets transition to homeless hangouts very quickly at times. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sheer number of down-on-their-luck or drug-addicted individuals is very sad. East Hastings was almost unbelievable. There wasn't much in the way of a downtown core - no central spot where you could soak in the city and its residents in a big public space. It also wasn't easy to see businesses where you could check out locally-produced clothing or jewelry or crafts, although you could buy Starbucks coffee just about anywhere. Granville Street and Robson Street had few options for tourists, and Granville was slightly off-putting for the number of people huddled in empty storefronts and slouched on the street, although it didn't feel especially dangerous, and nearby roads that ran parallel were much quieter options if needed. The Yaletown district had a few streets of restaurants, but again, not much reason to walk around. The Sun Yat Sen garden is worth a look, but much of the city seemed to involve knowing exactly where you wanted to go or what you wanted to see, rather than walking around and being surprised by charming finds. Other areas, like Kitsilano, delivered on charm, but downtown Vancouver had much less than you might expect for a city of its size.","August 2, 2015",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:19:08.719901,2021-06-18 18:19:08.801210

Beautiful Skid Row,,"While in Vancouver, BC last Saturday, the “hop on-hop off” (HOHO) bus was not stopping for pick-up a designated on their map.  I had an old map from a previous visit.  The stop, the Quality Hotel on Howe Street was recently one of the 26+ hotels purchased in Vancouver by the Canadian government for the homeless or potentially homeless population.  Since this SRO (single room occupancy hotel) was purchased, the HOHO’s stop was moved to a close Marriott property. I have stayed at the Marriott before.  This time the rates were 350 USD a night which is why I opted to make this a day trip from Seattle.  On the tour, the HOHO operator said Vancouver is second only to Hong Kong for being the most expensive city.I like the bus tour because you can roam freely and pick back up on the tour when you are ready.  I exited the HOHO and walked through Chinatown, then I went down Hastings.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_row  I walked for 8 blocks to the next HOHO stop.  There was a stench of body fluids, over 200 people sitting/ laying on the street with their belongs.  Turns out I was in the areas recognized as Vancouver’s Skid Row.

"A Friendly City, Something for Everyone, Good Value if the Exchange is Right.",,"We visit Vancouver BC often. We stay downtown, mostly at the West End because of all the people watching and interesting shops and vendors. Vancouver is separated into several small neighborhoods. A business district which is very clean, upscale, and full of nice eateries. A shopping district with everything from Tiffany's to Roots ( a store specializing in Canadian made clothing ). Yaletown, a yuppified, clean, upscale neighborhood that is located on False Bay, on the water with plenty of trendy stores. There is Coal Harbor, another upscale neighborhood that is nested between the Canada Center and Stanley Park, situated right on Hwy 99. The main street that most people are found eating, walking , and shopping is Robson…most neighborhoods downtown are well within walking distance to Robson Street. Downtown Vancouver is very bike friendly, we never drive our car, either walk or cycle. The cycle routes are well marked and directions are clearly separated . Generally a bike route will be on on side of a busy street, both directions together separated by concrete barriers…very controversial but excellent from a bike point of view. There is also great public transportation, the bus being the most convenient. $2.75 Can gets you a 90 minute pass, and all day passes are available for around $9. Canadian, $7. for seniors, the best place to get them are the 7-11 stores. There is a sky train and plenty of Taxi's. Sadly UBER is not in Vancouver yet.

Caters to different tastes and interests,,"Vancouver downtown covers a wide area of different aspects.  There is the business downtown which isn't all that interesting.  There is the shopping downtown that is interesting depending on your point of view.  There is the entertainment downtown which has a lot going on in the evenings.  There is the restaurant downtown which has something for everyone and then there is the tourist downtown.  There may even be more aspects but these are the ones I can think of offhand.  I would be sure to visit Robson Street and the Pacific Centre Mall for shopping.

Fabulous City,,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I got to Vancouver.  I knew they had high rise buildings, were a port city and so forth.  The tax ride from the airport to downtown, we passed by some really nice homes and neighborhoods.  The cab fare was $35.00 from the airport to our downtown hotel.  The taxi driver told us it is a great city, safe to walk day or night, even down alleys.  The driver we had for our one tour told us the exact same thing.  One thing I noticed unlike other larger cities is the lack of graffiti, which is a nice thing.  There is something for everyone in this city from small boutiques, touristy gifts to high end shopping.  There is also every kind of food imaginable here and walking down some streets the smell of curry, or charbroilers really filled the air.  Downtown is right next to Stanley Park where you can get away from the city for a while.

Apparently there is a real interest in greenery and landscape because it seemed that every building took pains to beautify itself with lovely trees, shrubs and flowers. It was quite impressive as you walked around the city.We spent most of our time in the West End and Coal Harbor areas, and one side trip to the Pacific Center area (downtown shopping mall). However, we were shocked at the (seemingly) homeless and vagrant on the street corners. There must be a valid reason but apparently the City of Vancouver looks the other way on these folks. I kid you not: some of them actually have their beds laid out on the street corners. We saw several who were obvious wasted and this was a bit disturbing because of the uncertainty it causes. It certainly detracts from the lovely city that is Vancouver.Other than that, this city is clean, the folks are very welcoming, and it is well worth a visit.","June 3, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:23:20.109854,2021-06-18 18:23:20.197971

Entertainment District,,"When reviewing ""Downtown"" I'm specifically addressing Central Downtown/Granville Entertainment District and the surrounding area (as opposed to Gastown, Canada Place, Chinatown, Yaletown, etc). I found the area clean, lively and vibrant with plenty of choices for food and drinks, from quick bites to full service restaurants. We stayed at a hotel in the middle of Downtown and found it very walkable to many entertainment options. Having said that, this IS an urban downtown area so you will encounter homeless and loitering. There were several young travelers/backpackers staying at a hostel in the area and hanging out at the eateries/pubs. Other young folks were fooling around on skateboards on the corners. But we never felt uncomfortable walking around and were never bothered by anyone. If this type of environment makes you uncomfortable, then I wouldn't suggest walking alone or after dark.  Also, some pubs and restaurants turn into nightclubs with DJs in the evening which brings out the partygoers.TIP: Stay away from the Eastside (also considered downtown), specifically Hastings Street. There are a high number of homeless and addicts in the area (canibis clubs and shelters too). There is nothing worth seeing there anyway, unless you want to witness street blocks literally packed with homeless people lined up with carts full of odds and ends, seemingly selling or bartering their wares to other homeless people.

amazing when it's sunny but pretty nice when it's not,,VAncouver has a right to call itself one of the best places to live and the downtown area epitomizes why.

It has a street layout that makes much use of the great green spaces and the easy access to the shores.  Lots of street art allows the local and the tourist to stop and admire the surroundings.

"Relatively Safe, Relatively Dull",,"I was born in Vancouver, and have lived here most of my life, so to me downtown is just downtown.  There are wonderful views if you are anywhere near the harbour, there are nice beaches (English Bay, Sunset, Second and Third Beaches), and Stanley park.  The West End, Central Business District and Yaletown are all pretty safe for a walkabout.  I would exclude from this last comment much of the area east of Carrall street (at the eastern end of Gastown).  There are also many very good restaurants.  Even with all this, I would still rate Vancouver's downtown as average in and of itself.  It lacks the excitement and variety of Manhattan, Tokyo, London or Paris; other than a few buildings such as the courthouse, the architecture is rather pedestrian.  The arts scene in Vancouver has taken several hits over the years with the closure of the Queen Elizabeth Playhouse, the disappearance of decent jazz bars in the city and I think even the Yale Hotel has closed its doors (the neon sign outside still advertises ""Live Blues Nightly"").So while there are many good restaurants downtown, and many good attractions in the downtown area, the idea of downtown being one of them just doesn't quite work.","May 22, 2015",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:24:01.646710,2021-06-18 18:24:01.859344

Fifth in a Five Horse Race,,"We've been to many of the other major cities in CA and while Vancouver is nice, it takes last place for us.  It just doesn't have the architectural charm of Montreal, the variety of Toronto, the rustic charm of Calgary or the history of Quebec City.  More over, Vancouver is very liberal and they promote that in the recorded tour messages and everywhere you turn.  Ever wonder where the pan-handlers and vagrants who were run out of other CA cities ended up?  One guess.  That said there are sights to see here that are worth seeing if you're going to be here anyway.  The people who serve you in hotels and restaurants are very nice and locals will help you find your way as you walk around their town.  We stayed a couple days after our cruise - one day would have been long enough.   If you plan to take the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour - look into some other options unless you don't mind the buses running as much as 50 min. behind schedule and a minimum 30 min. behind regularly. Rent a bike at ""Spokes"" and tour Stanley Park, the Seawall and Ferguson Point yourself.  Eat at the Tea Room @ Ferguson Point - they will take walk-ups on the outside patio so don't be discouraged if they say they're reservations are full. We got in on Mother's Day without reservations and the patio is the better view.  Granville Island is fine - not that many great shops but if you time it right - eat an early lunch in the Market.

The downtown area, surrounded on three sides by water: False Creek, English Bay, Coal Harbor and Burrard Inlet, offers so many marvelous vistas.  Yaletown offers trendy restaurants, as well as the park areas along Marinaside Crescent and Pacific Boulevard.  Gastown offers more restaurants and cafes, entertainment venues, and galleries.

I couldn't get over how culturally diverse the city was which was so refreshing coming from Boston!  Everyone seemed to keep to themselves (or so it seemed) and the city overall seemed rather laid back--nothing like NYC or LA by any means.

Robust Area,,"There are a variety of restaurants and shops.  I enjoyed the outdoor attractions.  It was Easter weekend so there was a lot going on. The Pacific Center is a bustling place.  There are several places to eat in the Center.  I found the souvenir shop on Seymour Street near Dunsmuir St., to be very nice, offering a variety of souvenirs at reasonable prices.  I do not recommend the Flaming Wok as I found the cashier to be dishonest. I didn't have the exact amount to pay for a meal I purchased with American Dollars, the cashier would not return change due me or give me a receipt stating rudely ""No change, we aren't a bank"".   I shopped and ate at several places during my stay and didn't have any problems, if my purchase for example was $8 and I paid with a US $10 bill everyone returned my change in CND currency.  I can only imagine how much this woman has gained, cheating people out of their money. I would not have bought food from her if I had known. At the very least she should post a sign and let others know she doesn't return change if paid in US dollars and others like myself won't buy from her.

I should quality this by saying, my husband and I are avid walkers and it is our preferred means of getting to know a new city.  It is such an interesting dicotomy with new modern buildings adjacent to older more historic areas.  To add further, there is an almost jarring drop off to the more improvished areas of the city (near China town as well).  Trust me, you will know it when you see it and smell it.

Wonderful city,,"What a wonderful city Vancouver is. It seems to offer everything from mountains to the sea, all easy to get to with public transport, free shuttle buses, the ferries or the sky train. All forms of public transport seem to be cheap in my opinion and take you right to where you want to go. As for the main downtown district everything is within walking distance and you can easily follow the roads as it it is set out in a grid system, like most North American cities. The shops are a great mix offering something for everyone, with those selling souvenirs dotted about. What I enjoyed about these is that the wares seemed varied depending on which shop you ventured into. There are also clothes shops, supermarkets and the sort of every day shops you would expect. Robson street is good for shops. Food is abundant with restaurants and take aways, coffee shops and pubs. For those on a budget some of the take away places towards the BC stadium offer some excellent deals. Granville Island is a great place for food as well as its bustling market.The city is clean and the people pleasant. There are a few homeless people around but they are no trouble.

Unfortunately our GPS took us to our hotel via Hastings Street.  I have never seen such abject poverty, despair, filth and degrading areas like this in my life and literally hundreds of people living on the streets there.  I felt like I was in a third world country and prayed to get through the area as quickly as possible.

The Village,,"It's been a few years since we were called a Village, but in many ways the downtown area really is small compared to cities like, New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong, or Los Angeles. You can get around Vancouver very easy on foot if your a walker/ or relatively fit person. With the city being wrapped in water on 3 sides, it's limited to growth in the downtown. Other than a small portion of China Town near Main and late nights on the Eastside of Gaston, the city is very safe and usually really clean. There is lots of construction currently under way so traffic is re routed and expect delays Monday to Friday for the next couple years at least. The major transit network of Skytrains, (subway) works well and is helpful especially if your going to and from the airport, Richmond, or towards New Westminister. There is also a great flight option via se planes from the convention centre area if your extending a stay over to Victoria. The flights on clear days would offer outstanding views of the Gulf Islands.

Downtown Vancouver,,"I love Downtown Vancouver, yes, it as it's homeless like most cities but it as so much more, the convenience of everything within walking distance; skytrain, Seawall, Stanley Park, restaurants, shopping, theatre's, harbour cruises, sea airplanes, museums and the awesome Granville island.","February 18, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:26:17.335727,2021-06-18 18:26:17.417868
WORLD CLASS RESTAURANTS,,"I now live in Los Angeles but was born and raised in Vancouver BC.You can't really go wrong in Vancouver when you go out to eat as the restaurants there are truly world class. Los Angelese' would posthumously disagree. Vancouver BC? Better than LA? Yes, and by a long shot. First of all let's look at the advertising for the LA eateries. Hollywood! Really? Kids in there 20's going to these fancy restaurants to eat and the press giving the food 4 and 5 stars because the stars say so. These celebrities would give 5 stars to Taco Bell. Please people, if you are interested in tasting the latest in food and drinks, Vancouver is the place. Chinese, Japanese, and Italian are among the best  and LA does not even come close. I went to Mr Chow's in Beverly Hills. It ranked down there with some chinese restaurants that are getting 2 stars in Vancouver and this is ranked 5 in Los Angeles. Eat drink and be merry in Vancouver, but go in the summer because it rains the rest of the time.","February 18, 2015",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:26:17.417874,2021-06-18 18:26:17.498587

Downtown Vancouver,,"I have been working in downtown Vancouver for the past 18 years.  I still enjoy going there every day.  Parking is expensive in downtown, and there are lots of buses, skytrain to take you there right in downtown.  My office is near Waterfront, at lunch, I often walk along the sea front, Canada Place-lot of activities there including Flying Over Canada' which I have experienced twice, Jack Poole Plaza-the fire torches of the 2000 Olympic, Western Bay shore and Stanley Park.  You will see sea planes taking off to various places along the way, against the back drop of North and West Vancouver, beautiful view of sea, sky and mountain  From Waterfront station, you can also walk to the steam clock in Gas Town.  It takes less than 10 minutes.  Also nearby is Pacific Mall which has lots of fashion and higher ends retailers for shopping. There are lots of restaurants and coffee places if you are hungry.  The Gelateria at Hotel Vancouver Pacific Rim is becoming a tourist spot, though I have tried a few times, for $6.50 an ice-cream cone is too pricy, and am too impatience to wait on the long-lined up. Downtown is especially pretty in Spring time, around March to May, where lots of spring flowers, and blossom trees are in their full glory.","February 9, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:26:27.306367,2021-06-18 18:26:27.386339

It is easy to get over to Stanley park with only a short walk from downtown or to ride a water taxi to Granville Island to get away from the busy downtown core or hussle and bustle.

There is so much too write about this very special city that I am not sure Trip Advisor would allow me to write an essay!Vancouver is a city blows my mind away, you name it from its restaurants to the fancy food carts to the shopping to the nite life, the surrounding areas such as English Bay. This city punches well above its weight. Vancouverites are among the nicest people I have ever had the privelage of meeting, so courteous, polite and ever helpful, no matter how small the problem/query you are guranteed a resolution or an answer with the utmost respect and dignity.Downtown Vancouver is a mega construction site at the moment, I cannot wait until completion day comes, the Nordstrom center is a monster, but at the same time incredibly environmentally crafted infrastructure, thus leading to attaining the highest credentials with respect to green technology.The transport system which is managed by Translink without a shadow of a doubt one of the most efficient and vastly developed transport systems in the world. The timing is excellent, not to mention the customer service is superb! Everytime I visit Vancouver there is always something new that springs up, no matter how small you can still notice. I highly recommend a visit to Granville Island, it has some of the finest micro breweries on tap in the world. Vancouver is currently going through a huge boom in micro breweries, now with the recent legal changes in relaxating the liquor laws Vancouver is about to take things to another level. Granville Island has a beautiful boat ride, it is a must do only on a sunny day!Vancouver is known for its stellar environmental credentials and it certainly lives up to its reputation.The downside to Vancouver is it is so spread out, not a friendly city for people who do not have their own means of transport. Vancouver is trying to rectify this issue however much work remains to be done in expanding the public transport system to the outerlying areas making it more accessible for people who dont drive a vehicle like myself.I fell in love with Vancouver and the people so much that I will be going back there in the middle of 2015.","December 30, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:27:05.641208,2021-06-18 18:27:05.722316

Most beautiful city on earth; don't drive.,,"There is no city in North America like this. Why? Because it's quiet - no freeways through the downtown area. Unfortunately, despite the huge benefit this gives, it also means that driving into and out of the core can be... stressful. Know where you're going if you're planning on driving. If you're from out of town, do NOT drive - take the train. It's the one thing the SkyTrain is useful for.","December 27, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:27:05.882649,2021-06-18 18:27:06.174281

Leave the car at home,,"We recently took a trip from Seattle to Vancouver for a 4 day stay. We had flown into Seattle from TX and rented a car to drive to Canada after a few days enjoying Seattle. If I do this trip again I would not rent the car. The drive was pleasant but not particularly scenic. There are better ways to go with less traffic concerns. I would do the train or ferry, more of an adventure and a much prettier ride. Once we were in Vancouver we parked the car in the Hotel for $35/day and didn't touch it again until we left. Downtown Vancouver was very easily walkable, there are hop on and off Trolley's that go everywhere and we used them like a cab, just get near where you want to go and walk the rest of the way, very pleasant, walkable city. Do rent bikes and ride around the Stanley Park trails, fantastic fun. Near the convention center is the worlds best gelato, just ask the Trolley driver, they where right.","December 19, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:27:15.842258,2021-06-18 18:27:15.923315

I stayed up late researching Vancouver homeless and found out that there is no real programs that help the homeless but, Vancouver pays for a program to have a place for free needles and a clean environment to shoot up.

"Walk everywhere, shop, and Enjoy!",,"When staying in downtown Vancouver there are a few things you should definitely do.  First, if shopping is your thing, Pacific Centre at the corner of Granville and Georgia Streets has lots of shops to browse through and right across the street is The Hudsons Bay store that is a shoppers paradise.  Robson street is a fun place to stroll and window browse, but the shops are high end and can be very expensive.  If you walk north down Hornby or Howe Street towards the mountains and water, you come to Canada Place, the Pan Pacific Hotel, and Vancouver Convention Center.  Do walk around Canada Place for some great views of the mountains and city, go into and check out the shops at the Pan Pacific Hotel and stroll over to the Convention Center to see the Olympic Flame.  If you continue walking along the sidewalk that runs along the harbour, just past the Convention Center, you will get more great views and eventually will enter Stanley Park, about a 20 minute to 30 minute walk from the Convention Center.  Along the way there are several restaurants, more shops, and some funky art work.  There are many things to see and do in the Park and you can walk around the entire sea wall, but keep in mind it is a very long walk to do the whole thing.(at least two hours)  Use the sky train or buses to get to BC Place stadium and then walk the seawall from there, along False Creek.  You will eventually come to an Aquabus wharf where you can board a water taxi to take you across to Granville Island, which is a great place to spend a few hours...lots of shops, places to eat, fun things to see and do.So bring comfortable shoes, an umbrella for the rain, and walk everywhere.  It's a very easy city to get around in.","December 15, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:27:16.276254,2021-06-18 18:27:16.358637

Outpost to the supernatural,,"Van is a quaintly widespread city nestled @ the cusp of endless adventure. Fact is, it would take an entire lifetime to explore everything that it, & furthermore, beautiful BC has to offer. The core of the city itself is a peninsula, & technically, before development - Stanley Park was once an island. The time has passed where, for 1000's of years, huge megalithic giants once stood tall & aboriginals stood alone - enveloping the lands that are now eradicated beneath asphalt, concrete & steel. If history is your forte', there are still many remnants of that magical period preserved all around the city, the surrounding lower mainland - & of course the entire province. But to really enjoy the past, you have to head to it - the forest & hills that is.When it comes to entertainment, BC can spell bring cash, because there is so much to enjoy there, yet like in life - it's best spots are free. The nightlife scene is adequate enough but since the hockey riots of '94 & '01, the rules are stringent & enforced during the revelry hours. So much that the mayor has gone as far as to impose early liquor store closings in some areas during large events. As well, the security is so tight in all the nightclubs along the strip that you can't leave to get fresh air or smoke once you are inside. So once you exit - there are no re-entries.Good restaurants are everywhere, Gastown is very old world unique, galleries are plentiful, but remember one thing - this is the playground of the rich & famous. So even a simple donair can cost you $9 on a good night - & they ain't no real of the East Coast variety neither. But the place rivals the rest of the country when it comes to moderate climates. As long as you don't mind a little rain in the winter, you are good to go - so dress accordingly.One final thing worth mentioning is the city's east end @ Main & Hastings. Unless you are comfortable around literally 100's of homeless, many of whom are addicts & some who have serious mental issues, stay away from there -  especially @ night! So either by skytrain, renting a car, bicycle, or 2 feet & a heart beat - there are many great attractions worth seeing in Vancouver, BC... so come 1 & come all.","December 3, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:27:25.357058,2021-06-18 18:27:25.437927

Great base for exploring the city,,"My wife and I chose to base ourselves in Vancouver's Downtown area during our recent visit and were delighted with that choice. Our hotel was on Burrard Street and if you follow it north it takes you all the way to the seafront where you will find Canada Place, GoFly Canada, the floatplane terminal, a marina and lots of restaurants, cafes and bars. Downtown features Robson Street which is the city's premier shopping location and also lots of  convenient travel stops: Burrard St station which gives you access to the rail network; bus stops for the regular city bus routes as well as the Trolley Bus tours and the complimentary tour bus to the Capilano suspension bridge in North Vancouver.Downtown is awash with great hotels, restaurants and bars but also has the advantage of only being a short distance from the West End, Gastown and Chinatown districts all of which have a real 'buzz' in the evenings. Downtown also has several interesting museums and galleries and, all things considered, I believe it is the ideal base for exploring all that the wonderful city of Vancouver has to offer.

Love the Atmosphere of Vancouver,,This was my first journey to Canada having visited the United States a few times and I was very impressed.  It has the big city energy of places like New York and London but was more picturesque and friendly.

Very nice city,,"I enjoyed the short time I spent in Vancouver, if only the weather was kinder! It is a scenic city ut not a big city at all.

"Walk around downtown Vancouver, it's marvelous!",,"It is so easy to walk anywhere in downtown Vancouver, you never need a car and if you have to use the transit system, it's easy and fast, especially the skytrain and Canada line to the airport.The city is well laid out and the downtown core is walkable and safe at any time of the day or night.  The sidewalks are flat and all curbs and intersections wheelchair accessible.  The vehicle traffic flows smoothly along one way streets and there are designated bike lanes everywhere.  The walk signs have second count downs so you don't have to guess if you are going to make it across the intersection before the light changes.There is so much to see and do in the city you will definitely need a few days to get acquainted.  People are friendly and shopping is as good as any major global centre.  There are tons of terrific restaurants and coffee shops and of course plenty of bars and night clubs for the late night crowd.  If you are into theatre and the arts, the city has a wonderful selection of venues to entertain you.  Come on into the city, you'll be glad you did.","November 8, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:27:58.087715,2021-06-18 18:27:58.168755
Lovely City,,"We spent 5 days in this beautiful city and found there to be much to do.  We took our bikes and were able to bike around the city since it is very bike friendly.  The city is clean and modern with more places to eat than you can imagine.  There is a huge park right downtown that circles the water allowing for excellent views of the city.  People were friendly.  It is true that the prices are a bit high as others have mentioned, but that is not unusual for such a cosmopolitan city.  We have yet to find a major city that does not have high priced hotels, restaurants, etc., along with the homeless.  That's all part of the experience of a city.","November 8, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:27:58.168761,2021-06-18 18:27:58.250891
A bit disappointed,,"If you like big, busy towns, than this is the place for you.   I found that this was similar to visiting other big towns - similar to Montreal and/or Toronto.   Plenty of shopping spots, lots of restaurants, rained a lot when I was there, so lots of umbrellas to bang into while walking for shopping.Avoid some streets where homeless reside, they take over streets, sleep on sidewalks, and of course ask for money - very sad to see and at the same time frustrating consider the obvious riches of this town.   Huge contrasts for homeless to riches within only a few blocks from each other. Don't misunderstand, this is a lovely town, worth visiting but not sure if I would go back again.","November 8, 2014",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:28:06.333938,2021-06-18 18:28:06.634261
Pushy Homeless and Extremely Expensive,,"Wow i didn't even know you could review a city but thank god i found this because people need to know!!  Don't come here unless you are rich and love homeless. A six pack of decent beer is around 12 dollars and the liquor stores close at 11..the bars and restaurants are INSANELY expensive.. There are some good shops etc but nothing I saw that sets it apart from any other mediocre city at best, and for that matter 150 miles south is Seattle-much much much nicer. Their public transportation system is a thing of beauty i must say..but the city seemed to be just burnouts who came because they can smoke weed on the street without being harassed by cops and homeless people who can live and beg on the streets and be a huge huge nuisance without being harassed by cops...speaking of, where are the cops here???","November 7, 2014",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 18:28:06.634266,2021-06-18 18:28:06.718136

Wonderful Downtown,,"This is a great city surrounded by harbors. Downtown includes Gastown which is our favorite area of the Downtown area.  Great historical area, lots of excellent restaurants, bars, interesting shops and excellent harbor and mountain views. It's easy to navigate Downtown and Vancouver in general because most of the streets run either north/south or east/west. Once you learn the major streets, it is relatively easy to get around.  We  met people from all over the world while there and loved the international feeling of the city. Amazing number of coffee cafes. There seemed to be a lot of homeless people but they tend to be located along the East Hastings Street area. We walked thru this area and had no problems but it may be an area to avoid as a tourist.

A delightful culinary tour of Little Italy!,,"I love culinary and historic walking tours, but they can be hit-or-miss. I researched a number of options before visiting Vancouver, and chose Taste Vancouver's Little Italy/The Drive walk because it seemed so authentic and friendly, and an opportunity to get to know an area I might not have discovered, staying downtown. And it did not disappoint!First of all, The Drive is a wonderful mix of family neighborhood/Bohemian/traditional shops and establishments, with a dose of contemporary and hipster elements. But the walk: It is a leisurely stroll that includes local history, personal insights into the businesses and the families that run them, and good food. A *lot* of good food! Over 2.5 hours, we visited 10 establishments and enjoyed authentic Neapolitan pizza, old school sausage sandwiches, cheese samples, cold cuts samples, a plate of spaghetti and meatball. We sampled wine from Piemonte, had fantastic hazelnut gelato, a perfect cappuccino, delicious cannoli, and more. We also met the owners/managers and employees of the places we visited, and got their personal insights and stories on the neighborhood and their own place in it. Very warm, friendly, fun, and informative, and truly a delightful way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Highly recommended.Please note: This review speaks specifically and uniquely to the Little Italy walking tour.","October 4, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:29:38.651852,2021-06-18 18:29:38.728953

I Love Vancouver !!!!,,"This is easily one of my favorite cities.  We arrived via cruise ship and left from the airport.  The port area is well maintained and was easy to maneuver, and the airport was also a breeze.  It is a beautiful city  with lots of things to do and see for people of all ages.  It has  a wonderful location with stunning views along the waterfront. Public transportation was fairly easy to maneuver (especially due to the kindness of the locals who offered guidance when we were looking a little confused in the tunnels leading to the train station), parking was not difficult and the many people we met while in  Vancouver were kind, warm and friendly - we found them very helpful  on several occasions.  Utilize the visitor's center as they have many suggestions and offer some discounted tickets for area attractions. The business district and waterfront district are very clean and safe.  There were many places to eat or grab a cup of coffee and the shopping was plentiful, if that's your thing.  Canada Place has lots to do with some fun attractions and the area near the Olympic Cauldron was a wonderful spot with wooden lounging chairs overlooking the water, access to the pathway running along the water, more restaurants etc.  I must admit we did run into a few beggars once we were on the fringe of this  waterfront area and the homelessness in the China town area was very sad and made for  a stark contrast between the haves and have nots with just a couple of blocks in between, heartbreaking for sure....  In that respect it was like any major city, anywhere. We actually avoided Chinatown for this reason.

Typical Big City Downtown,,"The downtown is a nice area. Lots of parking, easy to access via public transportation and not overly crowded. The parts directly near the downtown were pretty downtrodden and sketchy which was a shame to see. There are lots of eateries and coffee places. You'll be in caffeine heaven if you visit Vancouver. Parking is reasonably priced for a big city. My friends and I walked around (in the rain) for a few hours and weren't overly impressed. The Pacific Centre is vast but way out of our budget. If you're looking for high priced, designer brands then that's the place for you. I enjoyed a lot of the architecture. I was not a fan of being constantly approached and asked for change.

A true fashionable city,,"It was our first time in Vancouver, but it won't be the last one. The city has a nice atmosphere with a wide variety of shops and cafes.

Trip to Vancouver,,"I really don’t know where to start. For people that live in industrial town in Southern Ontario, Vancouver represents a role model city, the city you’d like to live in. We have spent seven days in Vancouver area and a couple of days in Victoria (I will have my separate review about Victoria, BC). We stayed with friends in small suburb city Port Coquitlam that is a part of Tri-Cities, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and Port Moody. I was literally “shocked” by public infrastructure composed into beautiful nature of this small city. Trails, playgrounds, tennis courts, berries, river, lakes etc. First day we spent in Port Coquitlam and drove to White Rock Beach. WRB is a small tourist crowded Riviera city but we loved it because it felt like you were somewhere at Mediterranean cost. Second day we spent on Burnaby Mountain (beautiful look to Vancouver and the sea inlet, than Grouse Mountain (what can I say, beautiful view of whole Vancouver. Third day we wanted to travel by public transport. We have purchased full day fares for all 4 of us and hit the road. 45 km to downtown took around 75 minute by buss (the buss frequently stopped). It is worth to visit a Visitor Centre in downtown to get maps, instructions, guidelines etc. A Vancouver waterfront is nice, view to ocean, Stanley Park, harbour, Olympic cauldron, Gas town, Granville Island (stores, market) and we decided to go back with Skytrain. We have heard that people complain about this public transport a lot. We were taking a Skytrain at 5pm it was crowded but not too bad. Next day we have spent in Stanley Park. Kids loved a second beach pool after long walks. A cost was $3 per person! Nice! Next two days we spent traveling to Victoria BC. Next day we have visited Capilano Suspension Bridge (what an experience – must see), Horseshoe Bay, and having our sunset at the Whitecliff Park West Vancouver (we didn’t have a bottle of wine but it would be a perfect end of the day if we had it. Next day, Whistler Blackcomb. I was pooling my hair out when I have realized that we have spent an extra day in Victoria and we didn’t do that in Whistler. You can see a million pictures of Whistler, gondola, ski lifts, ski trails, mountains, Olympic Village but it cannot do it for you! I am 45 and so far in my life I have never seen anything beautiful as a view from the top of Whistler! Stunning! Gorgeous! I’ll be back on day.

It's no longer the Robsonstrasse of 50 years ago, but no worse as a consequence. For lovers of urban life, Vancouver's West End is a compulsory destination.

"Compact, dramatic, surrounded by ocean, parks, and walking trails.",,"I love downtown Vancouver.  It has everything in a small condensed area.  You can be amidst the hustle and bustle of Robson or Granville Streets, or completely lost in the forests of Stanley Park.  The accessibility to the ocean is amazing via the never-ending seawall.

All the greenery adds balance to the skyscrapers, including the very cool green roof of the newest part of the Conference Centre.

Downtown Vancouver's liveable city,,"As I was taking some house guests from Montreal on a mini walking tour of downtown Vancouver last week, I thought to myself what a unique city it has become. Over the last twenty-five years or so, the old warehouse district of Vancouver's downtown has been transformed into a liveable neighbourhood with apartments and town homes, parks, grocery stores, and community centers. Mothers with strollers wheel through streets that used to house seedy nightclubs and hookers, so this change has been so welcome. Alongside this neighbourhood, there are many attractions for tourists to enjoy including the Art Gallery and Robson Square, The Main Library with its fabulous coliseum-like architecture, the Waterfront Convention Centre and Canada Place, Robson Street upscale shopping, and the historic Gastown with its steam clock and many vintage buildings. Each one of these areas hosts interesting stores and restaurants, along with our famous food carts that sell casual food from every corner of the globe. The West End and English Bay provide more entertainment delights as well as the beautiful English Bay and Sunset beaches bordering Vancouver's harbour, the local mountains rising in the background. The rainbow gay-friendly neighbourhood around Davie Village is also packed with good eateries and a youthful trendy vibe. All these sights can be explored on foot if you're a good walker, but if your feet start to ache, there is a good bus system plus efficient rapid transit to rescue your tired limbs. Or jump on a horse drawn buggy or trolley for a fully narrated tour of all major sights plus a history lesson thrown in as well.As I showed our friends all these sights on a clear sunny day in July, I couldn't helpfeeling proud of the creative mix of people and cultures that Vancouver has become, and this makes it a stunning travel destination for anyone willing to savor its delights!","August 5, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:33:51.133831,2021-06-18 18:33:51.215237

On our return on July 21 we found the rear power window of our truck had been broken (approx. cost to replace is $700.00) and a few items stolen from the truck. One of the Vinci Park staff came out and took pictures and at that time told us they were not responsible. When we returned home we again phoned Vinci Park and the lady took all the information and said she would speak to a manager. All we wanted was to be reimbursed our parking fee to help pay for the window.  We waited another week and phoned again, actually spoke to the manager this time, they were very rude, and we were told again that they will do nothing to help and do not do refunds. The bottom line here is that it ended up costing just over a $1000.00 to park at Vinci Park-Canada place, Vancouver B.C.","August 5, 2014",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-18 18:33:51.377806,2021-06-18 18:33:51.456614

Busy Area in Amazing Location,,"Downtown Vancouver offers lots of shopping, good restaurants and easy exploration on foot. Public transportation is excellent so a vehicle is unneeded and is to be avoided, if possible, because of the high cost of parking. If traveling by car, I highly recommend staying on the other side of False Creek on the West Side (I'm not referring to the West End or West Vancouver), where it is usually easy to find free parking.Then take a bus to Downtown Vancouver.The Downtown area shows off many high-rise, glass buildings, which I find to be uninspired architecture. But there are some standouts, such as the central branch of the Vancouver Public Library, which resembles the Roman Coliseum. Many homeless people are around, but they are quite harmless. Some visitors find it uncomfortable to walk from Gastown to Chinatown because there are often unsavory characters hanging out in the area between these two parts of the city. I have walked this segment many times during the day, as a lone female, and have never experienced a problem.For me, the best part of Downtown, aside from the pleasant people I always interact with there, is its spectacular location, with both mountain and water views plus magnificent Stanley Park on its western edge. Walking part of the seawall gives a good appreciation of the city's interaction with nature.","August 1, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:34:19.855185,2021-06-18 18:34:19.953313
Easy city to explore,,"I went to Vancouver for 9 days this July with my two older sons. It was an incredibly easy city to explore. I walked it and drove around in it and never had any problems with either. Driving made me a little nervous because the lanes just seem so narrow but we were fine. There are a lot of homeless people everywhere and drug use is obvious but I never felt unsafe. I've been in cities all over the world and despite what we saw here, this was one of the safest feeling cities we've ever been in. We explored miles and miles of Vancouver on foot and I wouldn't hesitate to do so again (like anywhere - just use your common sense.) We saw plenty of officers in marked and unmarked cars. We sat in the parks and only twice were we approached by people begging. The first time it happened the man was so polite we did help him with a little something. The second time I couldn't understand what he was saying (it was French) and told him to move on which he did. Some people stopped and just started telling us stories out of the blue while we were on the street. They were all very entertaining and after we said something like ""oh, that's nice"" they went on their way. Vancouver is a very busy city. There is always something going on. I am already looking forward to going back.","July 30, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:34:19.953318,2021-06-18 18:34:20.032523

"Spend some time in the city--Downtown Vancouver, BC",,"Vancouver is a beautiful city--so compact--that needs to be explored.  There is so much to do and so many great places to eat that you can spend days in the city and never run out of things to do!  Too many people look at it as a place to ""leave from"" instead as a superior destination.  This was our third time in the city--we never tire if it.  It is the Paris of North America!Plan to visit the gas light district--a couple of hours at a minimum.  Very nice shops and Inuit art stores.  The hop on/off bus is an easy way to take in the city ad to see venues that are of interest to you.  There is a free boat ride to Granville Island included in it.  The Island is a real adventure--lots to do, see and eat.Stanley Park is a real highlight.  The bus makes many stops there and you can pick it up every 15 minutes.Do not miss the gardens in the city--they are a real treat!  They are well maintained and have great plants for the region.  North Vancouver has some great antique shops.  South Vancouver has some wonderful art galleries with outstanding prices and willingness to mail your purchases to you.  Cruises out of the city are as easy as any city we have ever used.  They k ow how to move people!

Stanley Park,,"Probably the best urban park I've ever experienced, in its combination of magnificent walks along the water (English Bay and Burrard Inlet) and beautiful, tree-lined roads just inside the shore line. And the proximity to the West End makes it all the better.  Great paths for bikers and walkers too (although the markings for each group could be clearer; we witnessed two biker-walker collisions on a several hour walk).  Several good restaurants, playgrounds, and playing fields inside the park make it family friendly too, and easy to spend lots of time there doing different things.

The most beautiful dead city in the world.,,"I fell so much in love with Vancouver after several extended visits that I actually moved to the city.Mistake.  Angry, cranky city besieged with vast disparities in income and wealth.  It looks very pretty to the itinerant observer and it truly is a beautiful place.  The city's beauty is what destroys it.  People visit Vancouver and love it so much they buy a place here. Many, many of these people are wealthy residents of other cities.  These people buy up all the most attractive real estate; driving up prices beyond the grasp of locals and creating vast waste lands of seasonally occupied houses and condos.  Retail and restaurant businesses cannot get established due to the high property costs and lack of permanent residents to support them.  The most expensive parts of the city are virtual morgues 90% of the year.

Nice place.,,"Very cosmopolitan and a huge variety of places to explore and eat. Would help if one realised the street name placards at junctions actually run in the direction in which the street runs and that the numbers alongside refer to the building numbers around that intersection. Very useful when on West Georgia St where the numbers go up to about 900 and walking to the hotel whilst carrying baggage, from the sky train is not the best of experiences.

The layout of the streets is the typical grid, which is very easy to navigate.  Our only complaint is the number of transient street people.  They are probably easy for the locals to ignore, but it was difficult for us as we don't typically see such a large number of transients in the Pittsburgh area.

"Nice place, but ...",,"Arrived Saturday night. Sunday morning we walked down to the Waterfront and then along it. Due to a thick curtain of clouds right down to the horizon, we didn't even know that the beautiful snow-capped mountains were there. As we walked along, I was wondering when the relentless succession of high-rise buildings virtually hugging the the walking & cycling paths would give way to a more sympathetic waterfront with beach cafes backed by park land or similar - that is,  somewhere informal to sit and watch the sea planes take off and land. Nice enough to walk along, but gave up on the place for a drink and a snack, so we walked into town where most things seemed to be closed until we go to Gas Town.However, over the ensuing days, we grew to like Vancouver a lot. The atmosphere and people are friendly, polite and helpful.  Even the people approaching you for money are polite and not persistent.  E Hastings street with its community of drug addicts only looked threatening, but as we walked through no one approached us let alone hassled us.But there doesn't appear to be anywhere that is the heart of the city - but that's probably me expecting some kind of European thing where cities normally have a central square, small parks, an old part, etc.Good restaurants and coffee bars, but I'll review these separately - along with a few attractions but, just in case it's not listed already on TripAdvisor, just a mention of the Hendrix Shrine.  It's only open June to August. It's a lovely gesture for the person who acquired the place, but it felt a bit desolate and scrapply - eg the corrugated cardboard 'guitar-shaped' shop sign, the words 'Hendrix Shrine' painted up in a few places and some of the red-brick wall is made out of plastic.","April 27, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:38:07.518244,2021-06-18 18:38:07.619478

There are too many starbucks everywhere sometimes kitty corner to eachother??? The stores are just regular trendy stores like a giant shopping mall.

Vancouver World's Best Ocean & Mountain City,,I moved here to Vancouver in 1986 from England. No other city in the world is as clean and green and has the Pacific Ocean lapping against it's shores offering surrounding mountains views and legendary Stanley Park to experience. Downtown Vancouver is a safe city. Surrounded on three side by water you will find a wonderful climate that rarely freezes and is not as rainy as everyone makes it out to be. I have lived in Vancouver for close to 39 years and every weekend feels like a vacation because there is so much to see and do here. Vancouverites are an awesome local people offering high ethnic diversity and a true West Coast laid back charm. What other downtown can boast a multitude of ocean rich beaches with rockstar supernatural views? Vancouver chose decades ago to ban the use of major highways in it's downtown core. I might take you a little longer to get around but because of this one urban planning decision Vancouver offers a true downtown experience without noisy highways cutting up the city into sections. I used to live in downtown Vancouver's West End that is wedged between downtown Vancouver and on the other side runs directly into the Pacific Ocean and Stanley Park . . . . awesome place to live when you are young or retired.,"April 16, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:38:22.324822,2021-06-18 18:38:22.406613
So much to do in Vancouver,,"Vancouver is a beautiful coastal city with mountains as the back drop and the sea at the doorstep. Downtown Vancouver is a very walkable city with a diversity of areas to see. The West End adjacent Stanley Park has many cafés and small shops to browse. Robs on Street has several blocks of high end fashion stores and coffee shops. Visit Gastown for a touristy area, Yaletown for upbeat restaurants with outdoor seating and upscale boutique shops and go to Chinatown for real authentic Asia shops and restaurants. The only area to avoid is the Downtown Eastside near Hastings and Main Streets where unfortunately the homeless and some drug addicts prevail.","April 15, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:38:22.406619,2021-06-18 18:38:22.483005

Get out of downtown and walk, bike, or drive around Stanley Park, go to the Museum of Anthropology and the Nitobe Japanese Garden at UBC, see Queen Elizabeth Park, hang out at Kits Beach in the summertime, walk or bike around False Creek, or drive up to Whistler along the Sea-to-Sky Highway.","April 15, 2014",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:38:35.766333,2021-06-18 18:38:35.858120
Very walkable city,,"Vancouver proper is a very easy city to get around in, especially by foot, important if one is visiting by ship as the cruise terminal is part of the downtown core. The airport is a good 30-40 minutes away depending on the form of transportation. There are any number of suburban areas which are not as easy to access. One way to combat this is to buy a day pass for the transit system. This will, for one reasonable price, allow access to the bus system, skytrain (elevated rail system) and also to the harbour ferries to the North Shore.Lots of touristy attractions, tons of information available on line. Plenty of shopping opportunities, from inexpensive to very costly and a world class restaurant scene. All in all, lots to see and do, whether you are here for a day or a week.

One doesnt get lost in the bylanes and its worth exploring every one of them. Tons of shops and libraries eateries all along. The highlight of the downtown is the water front where you can see the top of the Grause mountains. I watched the water plans take off and land for hours together.

Rated worst city for traffic congestion in North America.,,"Normally a nice place to wander, only usual issues are based on aggressive and sometimes VERY foulmouthed panhandlers (even n my late 30's I am still learning new words). Yet this year seems to be particularly bad for road closures and construction.For anyone who knows the area, once you start heading to the heart of downtown, you need to take the sky train in. Right now there is a parking shortage as road closures due to construction and added bike lanes has highly limited access, and if you find a meter get ready to remortgage your house. I would suggest perhaps the bus, but these are also being effected by all the construction.Current roads closed (as bad as in some places 4 lanes now down to one lane, during rush hour) include Cambie, Granville, (Granville street bridge since summer), Richards, Seymour, Howe, Burrard (Burrard Street Bridge), Pender and Georgia. If you know Vancouver, it was already considered the worst city in North America for congestion (even rated worse then LA), so now that ALL major arteries going into city are at 50% or below capacity, well do the math.My opinion, come enjoy what the downtown has to offer another year when the City of Vancouver decides to start regulating road closures during peak hours.","December 5, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:39:56.842206,2021-06-18 18:39:56.924984

Vancouver Cities History Scenes,,"We love traveling to the Vancouver City downtown area and especially what is known as Gas Town near the North Side of the Pacific Ocean.

Area has other small and larger department stores within walking distance of Robinson St. and downtown core. Buses, taxi's are always going by and very reasonable. The other area we always enjoy is Gas Town street and area. See the Old Steam clock, very old decorated buildings from when Vancouver was discovered and people started their business, whether from fishing, logging or retailing and their restaurants and pubs. Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant, patio outside near side walk, Steam Boat Pub & Restaurant Brewery also our favorite and outdoor patio, lots of comfortable seating. Near Canada Place where you can relax, stay over night, catch a ferry or cruise boat and has fantastic views of the inner harbour with all the freighters of the world loading our coal, logs, ash and other minerals. Take a ride on a old river ferry in the inner harbour. See the view on top of Canada Place of Vancouver,s mountains, sky scrapers, revolving restaurant. You will see very old open taxi/tours bus carriers that take you all over the history places, and Stanley Park, Capilano Suspension Bridge, adventure experience for sure!

Beautiful city,,"This is a beautiful city but there are pretty much nothing to do except admiring the beauty of the mountains opposite the city. Things are extremely expensive in downtown vancouver so if you are on budget, perhaps stay away from downtown. There is an area that i think its pretty unique which is call East Hastings. The street is mainly inhabited by people who has drug addicts and homesless people but it is completely a safe place to visit. They dont really care about your existence. If you are worried of safety then i suggest not to visit. Downtown vancouver itself is pretty small, you only need about 3 days to complete the whole tour. I dont encoourage anyone to use the big bus tour because it is way too expensive. Its one of those cities that you won't miss out a lot even if you don't visit.

Vancouver Translink (Transit System),,"The city of Vancouver, located on a large island, has an Incredible transit system which enables visitors to traverse this beautiful city fast and fun.  A one day pass for adults is $9 ($7.50 for seniors), and provides access to a multi-faceted, well connected system that moves you above & below the traffic on SkyTrain and the West Coast Express at 3-4 times faster than a car/taxi as well as across the Fraser River via the SeaBus.  Purchase your ticket with a credit card at the first station & off you go.  Although the buses require you to scan your ticket, that's not the case for the SkyTrain or SeaBus so we assumed that it's an honor system.  Depending on your ability to tote your luggage, the system will quickly take you to any port, but for obvious reasons this is inadvisable during rush hour. Unfortunately, the system isn't connected to the airport so you're well advised to book a room at a hotel that provides free shuttle service to/from the airport (and, for the record, the 'airport' hotels are actually located downtown because the airport is sited on a small peninsula).","September 30, 2013",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:41:32.087270,2021-06-18 18:41:32.173583

Sea Bus a Secret Find,,"This is one of those fun things to do because a ""local"" told you about it and I'm talking about the Vancouver Sea Bus. In my opinion, one of the most fun things to do in Vancouver at a most reasonable cost. The Sea Bus runs from downtown Vancouver's waterfront to the lower Lonsdale area in North Vancouver. You'll see the most beautiful city in the world fro your own viewing area aboard this foot passenger Ferry (Sea Bus). You'll float across Coal Harbour to the North Shore where you'll disembark and enjoy Lonsdale Quay (shops, restaurants, fun stuff for kids). And if you are adventurous, walk of the Ferry and take the Bus to Grouse Mountain...all for the same fare. Check the Kiosks for Fares as the do vary but should be no more than $5.50 at peak travel times. While travelling on the Sea Bus, watch for the many harbour Freighters that are waiting to unload..it's a fantastic site. I promise the Sea Bus is one truly fun idea while visiting Vancouver, so enjoy!","September 22, 2013",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:42:03.614148,2021-06-18 18:42:03.691578

Long walk on a hot day,,"We started our walk at the Scotia Bank building after having lunch in the underground food hall. We walked across to the Court House and Art Gallery but they were closed.

We saw the Shangri La Hotel (the tallest building in Vancouver) which my Grandson found out has 61 floors. We walked down to Canada Place where there is a convention centre as well as the main area where cruise ships come in. We also watched the flying boats take off and land. It is quite hilly around here as we found on returning to the central area. On our first visit we walked along the coast past the Marinas full of wonderful boats and round to the edge of Stanley Park, before returning back up Georgia. We walked to the Harbour Centre to visit the Lookout Restaurant. As in most big cities there are many boutiques and well known stores. Everywhere is very well signposted and it is easy to work out where you are as the streets are on a grid pattern. On another day we walked to see the Cathedral and on down into Gastown to see the famous steam clock. As cities go Downtown is not a massive area and much of it can be seen on foot quite easily.

Dense Can Be Good,,Walking about Downtown Van is do-able and enjoyable. And that is saying something from a city-phobe who hates crowds. The close proximity and tall scale seems to work somehow.  Maybe it's because of the geographically induced compact nature of Vancouver's neighbourhoods but it entertains and there is always something different and interesting just steps away.  Walking surfaces can obstruct however and it seems accessiblity is not an issue locals prioritise...lack of a necessity to adapt to winter snows might be one reason.  Blithe ignorance might another.

"Browsing and shopping and eating in a beautiful, friendly environment",,"The thing that strikes me first about Canada is how friendly and open everyone is.  You can always have a really interesting conversation with anyone serving in a shop, or bar or restaurant - they have time for you however busy they are.  Downtown Vancouver is beautiful - you are never far from glimpses of the sea or the mountains.  There are some quite interesting old buildings and curiosities like the steam clock in Gastown, which chimes tunes through its organ-like steam pipes every quarter hour.  Shops vary from the 'naff' souvenir outlets to much more interesting shops selling 'First Nation' indigenous artefacts, from jewelry and art to clothes and toys.  Worth visiting the Inuit Art Store/Museum off Cordova Street (but you will be investing, not just buying, if you purchase any of it!) The public bus services are excellent - $2.75 for any length of ride, one way only - but you need the right change ready in advance - or a season ticket.","August 19, 2013",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:44:14.429752,2021-06-18 18:44:14.507993

Vancouver Downtown,,"Over 700,000 people live in this city.  If you divide the city in half vertically, the people on the western half are worth over one million dollars and the people on the eastern half are worth less.  We were told by our hotel clerk not to venture out on the streets until after the rush-hour traffic (after 9:30 a.m.)  Plan on having megabucks to pay the parking meters:  $3.00/hour at Stanley Park aquarium and $1.75/half hour at the Museum of Anthropology for the parkade--that's in addition to the admission fees.  The informational signs are in English, French,  Chinese, and Squamish--no Spanish.  It was relatively easy to follow the flow of traffic on Hwy. 99 with good highway signs to find our way out of the city to cross the border into Washington  State.  According to a newspaper article I read while there this July, they were running out of room to build, and the only place to build now was ""up.""  The housing condition is crowded.  We were told the the mainland Chinese are coming here to buy property and inflating the cost of real estate.  A 1970 house with about 1,000 square feet was selling for $538,000; a half duplex was selling for $409,000.   The average cost of dinner for two meals ranged between $60 and $80 with no appetizer, beverage, or dessert, plus the added cost of parking.

But Vancouver has to be the friendliest, healthiest, cleanest, greenest, safest, slimest, the most polite and courteous, the most bicycle friendly city that we have ever been to. We are from San Francisco and we were amazed to see how clean the streets are. I heard car honking maybe 5 times altogether. We did not see a single policeman the six days we were there. When I wanted to change lane, the other drivers always let me. Motorists always yield to pedestrians. Pedestrians rarely jaywalk. My wife only weighs 100 lbs but she said she felt fat seeing all those slim girls.

What a great city!!,,"After being there four days, I started looking at real estate. It may be too pricey to live there (especially now a days) but it's still one of the best places I've been to yet. First, it offers too lifestyles, which is good for those who need a weekly change of pace. You have the city life and you have the outdoors-mountain & sea life. Downtown has a ton of restaurants, shops and plenty of parking. There are a few too many one-way roads for my taste. And  there is a really seedy area just adjacent to a great tourist attraction, Gastown, that had me locking my doors.Outside of the city, on the perimeter you can go for a swim, sunbathe, bike ride, walk, roller skate, picnic...it's all very relaxing. Cross the bridge to North Vancouver and there is suburbia, and more outdoor activities...hiking, skiing, kayaking, hang gliding, rock climbing..etc.The weather-I went during the summer.

Getting round is easy, walking, public transport or bikes - there are lots of dedicated routes and easy to get to some great beaches nearby - or even floatplanes to coastal locations.  Traditional culture is limited but not absent but there is certainly a vibrant arts and entertainment scene.

Fun day,,"After Granville Market we went back onto the red bus to the Chinese Scholars' Garden.  We stumbled onto a guided tour and sort of wished we had not, as it was TMI.  The garden was lovely but if I had realized there was another Chinese Scholars' Garden 4x its size in Seattle I would have skipped the one in Vancouver.  We ate lunch in a dim sum place in China town recommended by the Garden staff.  It was okay but not spectacular.  We drove by the Steam Clock and then got off and walked toward Canada Place, stopping to mount the elevators to the outlook over the city.  Not worth the money and the signage did not seem accurate to what we were seeing.  Canada Place made for some nice photos and I loved the Canadian Mountie store, where I indulged in a frig mag and a cute Mountie to hang from my Xmas tree.  By the time we got back on the bus we were tired so we just observed Stanley Park from inside the bus.  It looked lovely.  We rested a little and had a glass of wine on the lovely roof deck of the Times Square Suites (see separate review) before heading toward our wonderful dinner at Adesso (also spearate rveview).

roadtrip Vancouver stop June 2013.,,"We went for a road trip, and had a blast. mom, dad and kids (8 yr old boy and 5 yr old girl) packed our van with luggage and groceries and went for a tri city tour, with the assistance of  GPS ,our beloved white Toyota Sienna we lovingly call Filmore, First Stop: Vancouver BCday 1 was arrived late, drove from Oregon, crossed to the USA to Canadian border. Checked in, walked around the city. What can I say, we had a blast, we stayed at Blue Horizon for 3 days (which is also a pick up spot for our hop on & off  tour bus) in Robson St, they had lots of restaurants options at that area, all the cuisine is available- such as italian, japanese, irish, chinese, fish and chips...etch.Blue Horizon is in the middle of everything. Robson is like their open mall, so if you wanted shopping district, stay here. We opted for the higher floor (25th floor) and facing the bay too. Our view was funtastic. Parking fee was about 16/per day. The room was modern chic with flatscreen tv. We liked our room. day 2: we did the bus tours and strolling around the Canada Place (it's the waterfront area) they have a food court on the basement area and little shopping. I bought our Japanese lunch there. It was made to order. I had Yakisoba's and kids had shrimp tempura. They have the Tim Horton's down in the food court, I got some  there, bought coffee and donuts. Chocolate donuts was so good. day 3: we drove to Lyn Canyon Park on the other side. It was free of charge !!  We did some trail hiking and, they have suspension bridge, falls, hiking area, lush trees. We had a great time. It was a learning experience for the kids, that we need to take care of the environment. day 3: We crossed over to Victoria :)","June 22, 2013",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:46:47.083636,2021-06-18 18:46:47.160931

Very disappointed,,"Our overall experience in Vancouver was very disappointing.  Everything was very expensive and the merchants were very unfriendly.  These are the people that should be going out of their way to be friendly and helpful but instead acted as if they were doing you a favor by letting you shop in their stores or ride in their cabs.  When asking for recommendations of where to go or what to do they offered no help at all.  The exception to this was the hotel staff at the Comfort Inn in Downtown Vancouver.The private citizens on the other hand were very friendly and helpful, usually going out of their way to answer questions.  For example, we asked for directions to get to a walkway on a bridge and the person not only gave us great directions, she walked with us to show us exactly where to go.","June 21, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:46:47.406891,2021-06-18 18:46:47.485503

Lovely City - but only in parts,,"We had a total of 4 days in Vancouver to top and tail an Alaska Cruise.  It is a bright, modern, cosmopolitan city with a lot of lovely places to visit.  We stayed centrally and loved the Downtown area and Gastown and visited Granville Island, Stanley Park and Grouse Mountain. So, what's not to love?  Walk one block in the wrong direction and the huge number of homeless people, panhandlers, junkies etc etc becomes a problem.  This beautiful City has a real problem!  Okay, our hotel information book did tell us that there were certain streets we should avoid, but taking a shortcut back to our fabulous hotel, we landed bang smack in the middle of it!  Not a nice place to be on a Saturday night - and the only evidence of the Vancouver PD was a cruiser  parked up (I think this may be an ill founded tactic to try to provide public reassurance as there was no sign of any police officers in the car or vicinity).Also, midday on Saturday, we came across people sleeping rough - not only in shop doorways, but on the edge of the sidewalk adjacent to the road!  Again - a police cruiser but no officers in the area.  I felt so strongly that I emailed the Mayor's office to give him a tourist's view of the city.  That was several days ago and, no surprise, no response to date.  I just hope he does something about the problem!   This is a lovely city with lots to offer the tourist - but they need to open their eyes - see the problem and do something about it!!","June 13, 2013",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:47:02.544156,2021-06-18 18:47:02.621050

A City of two halves,,"My wife and I visited Vancouver for the first time in late May/early June 2013.  We stayed for a total of 4 days and visited a lot of what Vancouver has to offer.It is indeed a great place to visit and we enjoyed our time in the City, however, there is a danger that the problem of homelessness (which is already significant) and in my view, excessive litter might begin to effect visitors perceptions of what is a great place.We saw many homeless people at all times of the day throughout the downtown area.  Indeed many were sleeping in the middle of the sidewalk (one at 1130am on a Sunday morning) with the general public having to pick their way around them.  As we walked the main downtown streets we would observe individuals and groups of homeless people hanging about in many of the lanes which ran off the main streets.  Our Hotel also made specific reference to a certain district within the downtown area which they recommended we avoid since it was a frequent gathering place for homeless people and drug addicts.Having observed the problem at first hand, my wife felt so strongly about the issue, that she emailed the Mayor via the City web site.  We await a response.On the positive side, we enjoyed the Gastown area and the waterfront area near to Canada Place.  The City is a place that we will visit again, however, there is a need for the Authorities to do more about homelessness before it effects tourism.","June 11, 2013",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:47:14.069529,2021-06-18 18:47:14.161954

Glitzy sparkly Vancouver,,"Vancouver downtown is probably one of the main reasons why this city is often dubbed as 'the most liveable city in the World'. Vancouver is incredibly clean, neat, sophisticated and easy to get around. You can walk to most places within downtown but if you want to go across town or don't feel like walking, there are buses and the lovely SkyTrain. My favourite things to do in downtown Vancouver include:- A sunday walk in Stanley Park, starting from the south side, cutting across the park through Beaver Lake and coming out on the north end with beautiful views of Lion Gate Bridge and then leave the park near Coal Harbour.- Late morning ride on the Aquabus from Hornby St pier to Granville Island and lunch in the Public Market. Do you like hats? Visit the Granville Hat Shop.- Cocktail hour? Head to the bar at the famous Fairmont Hotel Vancouver. Excellent service in an exquisite location.- Check out the exhibitions at the Vancouver Gallery and visit the gallery shop.- You need a decent cup of coffee and a huge slice of cheese cake and like to avoid the horrid cafe chains? Melriches Coffee Shop on Davie Street is your place. - Sick of big supermarket chains? They have their own independent supermarket in Davie St; owned and operated by the neighbourhood.- If you like burritos, Red Burrito on Davie St is a 'must'!- For shopping, head to Pacific Centre or Metrotown- And remember that you can take a 4-hr train ride from the amazing Pacific Central Train Station in downtown Vancouver to Seattle. This is the most scenic train ride you are likel to have as most of the train ride is along the north west pacific coast. In summary, Vancouver Downtown is how every civilised city should be.

A very strange mix,,"I really wanted to rate the downtown Vancouver area higher, but felt strongly about what my wife and I experienced on our recent trip.  Vancouver was a very pretty city with a strange mix of cultures and infrastructure.  For instance, 2 blocks from our hotel was a very posh, ritzy, area with plenty of monetary influences.  We stood at a cross-walk and watched no less than 5 Mercedes and two Ferrari's drive by.  But then we would venture another two blocks and be greeted by terrible smelling streets (imagine if portable toilets had overflown) and trash literally strewn about in every direction.  We were even warned by our hotel about certain parts of town to stay away from.When it came to strolling around town for some light shopping or dining, we were again greeted with a strange mix of choices.  It was either the ultra luxury retail stores, or some very old very worn souvenir shops.  No real middle ground existed.  The same was true of the dining experiences.  It was either very high end dining, or tiny cafe's (we did see a Carl's Junior).  And we were very disappointed in the Olympic Village area of Vancouver as well.  It was still listed as a ""destination"" on our map, and in our guide book, and when we got there the only thing we found was a housing development.  Granted the condo's looked nice, but nothing indicated that this was where the athlete's had lived.  If you didn't know the Olympics had been in Vancouver, you would have NEVER guessed based on actually being there now.  And the plaza of nations has been turned into a casino.  Again, we were very disappointed in what the city has done with its olympic buildings.We came to the conclusion that Vancouver might be best experienced as a 1 night or 1 day layover to somewhere else in Canada.  A lot of cruises take off from Vancouver, as do tours destined for Whistler and other parts of the Canadian frontier.  So come a day early for your cruise or tour, just don't stay much longer than that.","June 6, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:47:30.801720,2021-06-18 18:47:30.882292

BORING What happened to Vancouver?,,"Wow. Clearly I do travel frequently. I spend more time overseas than I do closer to home. Looking in on Vancouver BC the now most expensive city anywhere in North America it has become lame, and boring. The streets have people sleeping all over them in some quarters. No shame. Most street corners have panhandlers. Deplorable. The excitement is gone. People are not friendly and avoid eye contact. Most are lost in their texting or PDA frenzy. Bicycle riders are rude, abusive, and do not adhere to the rules of the road. In general it is gray at street level. The stores are uninteresting and displays are classic fifties. Food places are very good and there are many to choose from. There just seems to be a lack of a heart beat downtown. Nightlife and quality entertainment does not exist other than drinking holes and third rate stage productions if any at times. A city this size with none quality jazz life, great night clubs/dinner clubs, etc. A town this expensive lacks anything depicting the old fashion pinache of money, glitz, and world class reflection. BORING. Oh well, good old Seattle is not far away and be it reasonably dull there is always the Pike Street Market that still out classes the Granville Island Market totally. Granville Island Market is a sense of contrived where Pike always feels human and natural.","May 28, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:47:58.845146,2021-06-18 18:47:58.922904

This is the most beautiful City in the World.,,"Sometimes I read these reviews and I feel inspired to write because some of them are just so off base you wonder if the people actually went to the places they write about. Vancouver is probably the most beautiful City in the World. Its situation is specacular -surrounded by Mountains and on the Pacific with an inlet in front and behind. Not only that but the City itself has just the best layout with visually interesting dynamics. Plus it has a huge park that juts out into the sea that takes hours to walk around the outside seawall. This place is magnificant. And - great restaurants, pubs, shops, transit from Airport.Its clean, its safe, it has lovely hotels and great skiing nearby plus tons of beaches- yes, you can ski in the am and come down to the beach in the afternoon and dine at night. You actually can't beat Vancouver. New York has become full of name brands, paris is always grey and quite dull, London is still fun , Amsterdam is lovely but Vancouver is THE best. Ps. I liked Prague too- lovely rooftops- and San Miguel Allende.","April 26, 2013",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:48:36.187713,2021-06-18 18:48:36.270693

The stay, which included an evening at 'The Centre for the Performing Arts', to attend a Goh Ballet performance of 'The Nutcracker', was a shared Christmas gift, and much-enjoyed.Much of downtown Vancouver was decked-out for the holidays - here are some of the venues and sights we enjoyed:- Robson Square -- alive & colourful - with public ice skating, and a band performing Christmas and other music.  We did not skate, but we sure enjoyed absorbing the sights & sounds of what was happening there one evening. - Hyatt Hotel -- the 'gingerbread and other pastry creations and displays' in the lobby -- some of the designs and constructions were almost unbelievable - but all, from the simplest to most complex were wonderful to behold!!  And if you stood close to many, you could 'savour' the scents of their makings.  This was the best display we saw during our walkabouts.- Canada Place -- a morning walk along the Canada Trail to soak in some of the harbour sights, and see the Woodward's window displays.  Great natural sights & sounds, combined with the window displays - though the latter, were just 'shades' of what Woodward's used to display in their store windows. - Four Seasons Hotel -- some beautifully-decorated Christmas trees in the lobby.- Pacific Centre -- some more beautifully-decorated Christmas trees in the Mall.Along with browsing some other stores, streets, and the like, we thoroughly-enjoyed experiencing some of the sights & sounds of Christmas in our downtown Vancouver walkabouts.","December 25, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:50:45.070350,2021-06-18 18:50:45.149883

"Scenic and walkable, but increasingly aggressive homeless population",,"We travel to Vancouver once or twice a year, and one of our favourite things to do is walk around downtown, enjoying the restaurants and taking great photos. The main problem is that the homeless population, which has always been present, is becoming more aggressive. For example, during our most recent trip, when we silently walked past a man who approached us and asked for money, he suddenly began spewing profanities and insults because we ignored him/ wouldn't give any money. He started following us down the street until we ducked into our hotel lobby. We are seasoned travellers and do not scare easily, but it has been disconcerting that we are feeling a little more on guard with each trip to Vancouver.","December 8, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:51:00.892536,2021-06-18 18:51:00.971839

Nice Stroll...,,"I'm not sure what warrants ""Downtown Vancouver"".  However, we've walked Canada Place and watched the cruise ships go in and out.  We've also walked around Gas Town, named after Gassy Jack.  Be sure to stop at the gas clock for a photo op!  There are many shops and restaurants in this area.  A short stroll over is China Town, which is always a wonderful place to shop or eat.  The small park in China Town is a beautiful area to sit and admire the koi and just soak up that peaceful feeling.  Although the large department stores of yesteryear are gone (mostly), there are still many places to shop and eat ""downtown"".  There are a few nice parks, plenty of hotels, and some nice movie theaters as well.  Quite often, there are demonstrations or parades.  We hit a very strange one on our last trip -- a ""Zombie Parade"".  Nearby, there is also Stanley Park.  Here you can enjoy the totem poles, see lots of geese - plus other small critters - also watch the cruise ships, bike, hike, soak up the sun.

Vancouver highlights,,"Long weekend in Vancouver (BC)As the Labour Day holiday was approaching this year, Vera and I were making plans how to spend this long weekend in neighboring province of British Columbia. Our plan was to drive there and visit our friends in Langley (BC) and we also wanted to finally tour the city of Vancouver. I knew, it was going to be a long drive, but I like driving so off we went on Friday morning (I had an extra day off from work) via Jasper and Kamloops on this 1000 km journey through western Canada.Vancouver was our destination for this journeyHighway journeyWe took Yellowhead highway 16 to Jasper and continued (without stopping) on highway 5 through Valemount and Clearwater, all the way down to Kamloops. We then continued down Highway 5 (the Coquihalla Highway) down through Merritt and Hope to Chilliwack. Some say this road is a toll road, but we didn’t have to pay for this road (Sep 2012). It is a good, double lane road, though. From Chilliwack I drove on the highway 1 straight towards Vancouver and took exit for Langley.We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house. We discussed our plans for the next day and went to bed early, so that we’ll be well rested for the long touristy day in Vancouver.Sea-to-Sky HighwayLangley is a short 45 minutes drive from Vancouver and we made to the city by avoiding the busy highway 5 where there are always traffic issues. Instead we used the “Sea-to-Sky Highway”, which is actually highway 99. This highway travels along the scenic Pacific Ocean vistas, bustling communities and parks. Smooth moving traffic at the times we’ve been on it. The “Sea-to-Sky Highway” is the name given to the section of Highway 99 starting just north of Horseshoe Bay. From Horseshoe Bay, the highway travels along the coast of Howe Sound for 12 km to Lions Bay, north for another 21 km to Britannia Beach, and further north for 11 more km to Squamish, at the head of Howe Sound. We left the highway once we reached the city as we were heading towards the North Vancouver. We wanted to visit well known tourist attraction ‘Capilano Suspension bridge’.Arial view of VancouverVancouver CityWe’ve been in Vancouver previously, but never had time to be a real tourists and see the city from that perspective. Here is my short story and how it went this time…Our 2-day itinerary of Vancouver began in Vancouver’s North Shore where we visited Capilano Suspension bridge. From there we went into Stanley park and stopped at the downtown peninsula in the heart of the city to walk the Vancouver’s Port Metro and Gastown area. All those spots provided a small glimpse of what makes Vancouver Canada’s most beautiful city.Vancouver Yacht clubVancouver is, after all, one of the cities that routinely tops those lists of the world’s greatest places to live. But beyond the breathtaking snowcapped crags, city-hugging beaches and dense waterfront forests lies a comparatively young metropolis that’s still trying to discover its true identity – less than 150 years after a ‘gassy’ Englishman rowed in and kicked it all off with a makeshift pub.Arial view of Vancouver harborCapilano Suspension bridgeYeah, it’s a tourist trap but I like to be a super tourist and do touristy things when I travel. At $34 a pop to enter it is not cheap. Food is expensive in the park but you get a free poncho if it might rain… lol! It didn’t when we were there… instead we had a great weather! It’s a great look at nature for someone from the big city like us.Capilano Suspension bridgeThe park itself is quite scenic and has some interesting activities: network of short suspension bridges between trees, a semicircular bridge jutting out from a cliff, some cool informative displays, and of course the Capilano bridge. But on a weekend it was full of tourists, who thought nothing of holding up everyone behind them to get several shots of their kids with no one else in the frame. That made it for very slow bridge crossing. If you’re sensitive to heights and bridge swinging, you shouldn’t go.Swinging Capilano Suspension bridgeSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffThere are no true hiking trails, and the park is not very big, you will cover all the ground in about 90 minutes. I would say it would be worth it for ~$15, but the fee is extortionate and a true nature lover would be better served elsewhere. I can see how it is great for families or people looking for a manageable nature walk. If you do go, take your time and explore everything, the views throughout are lovely.Network of short suspension bridges between treesCurrent admission to the bridge is $34 for adults, $27 for teens, and $12 for kids 6-12. We could go free to Lynn Canyon. What do I think beauty is worth? Can I afford this much money for this one attraction though? You could argue there are more bridges and things to see at Capilano, but the thrill of crossing a suspension bridge was the experience we were looking for. Going to the free, public Lynn Canyon bridge would fit the bill just fine… perfectly even. So, next time I’ll go there…Capilano Bridge HistoryIt was about 1890 that George Mackay discovered the spot, where Capliano Suspension Bridge now stands. Impressed by the beauty of the land, he built a cabin for himself and his wife. Then, with the help of local natives and a team of horses, he pulled taut the first cedar plank and hemp rope bridge 450 feet across and 230 feet above Capilano River.Mackay’s friends began their journey to the bridge by crossing Burrard Inlet abroad the S.S. Senator. A long trek up the rough trail that is new Capilano Road led to their being dubbed, Capilano Tramps. The encumbrances of their dress did little to deter the spirited adventurers, who steadily visited the bridge. It was such a popular attraction that a second, and more secure, wire bridge was built in 1903. Another wire bridge, with both cable ends firmly encased in concrete, was built in 1914.In 1911, the Tea House (now the Trading Post) was built on the edge of Capilano Canyon. Later, during 1930s, bridge owner, Mac MacEachran, initiated the tradition of inviting local natives to place their totem poles on the grounds. The totems, you see here today, are maintained in the exact condition, in which they were received about 1940. This is unlike many of the poles, you may see elsewhere, which have been allowed to deteriorate with the passage of time.At the end of cliff walksBeautiful scenic canyon deep down under the bridgeDuring this 1930′s Depression, two Danish carvers, Aage Madsen and Karl Hansen, arrived at the Bridge to sell their craft. In return for provisions and shelter in a small shack, on the far side of the Canyon, they carved the life sized native Indian statues that are scattered throughout the Park. The European perception of natives is apparent in the Plains Indian attire of the figures.The only exception is the carving of Mary Capilano, who is dressed in typical West Coast fashion with papoose Mathias Joe Capilano on her back. Mary was the only local native the two carvers had actually met.In 1956, the present bridge was built. This time the pre-stressed wire cables were encased in 13 tons of concrete at either end.Several attractions have been added to the Park in 1990s, including The Story Center and Living Forest Exhibits, the cantilevered deck along the Canyon edge, the big house native carving center, the Pioneer Garden and the Loggers’ Grill…Stanley ParkLook at an aerial map of Vancouver and you’ll see the huge patch of green dominating the downtown peninsula. This green patch is Stanley Park Vancouver, the gem of the city that makes Vancouver what it is. The park is nearly 1000 acres in size, reflecting the city’s love for nature and appreciation for preserving green spaces, even in such a quickly-growing area.unner statue of Harry Jerome (Canadian Olympian three times: 1960, 1964 and 1968) in Stanley ParkStanley Park is the largest urban park in North America, and opposed to other famous North American parks such as Central Park in New York, Stanley Park Vancouver is not just a manicured sprawl of lawns and neatly planted trees. What makes Stanley Park unique are the amazing views on the wrap-around Stanley Park seawall, the dense rainforests, the marshland, and the beaches.Stanley Park mapThe Stanley Park seawall follows the park along the Oceanside with bike and pedestrian pathways. Every day joggers, bikers, rollerbladers, walkers and others out to enjoy the view can follow the Stanley Park seawall for 10.5 km along the beach. Away from the seawall and the perimeter of the park, a dense forest grows, where few people actually spend much time. Like other parks, there are also plenty of lawn areas to play soccer or toss a Frisbee, and a number of beaches for sunbathing and volleyball. On this beautiful and sunny September’s Sunday, when the temperature was reaching almost 30 degrees, park was really crowded and people were everywhere. We drove around the park as it was difficult to find parking. It was still enjoyable…Lions Gate Bridge viewed from Stanley ParkFamilies enjoying the bike ride in the parkStanley Park history begins in the early stages of the city’s development. In 1886 the city council made the insightful decision to turn what had become a military reserve into a park. The towering cedars, swamp lands (now known as Lost Lagoon), and prime water-front property were all set aside for the “use and enjoyment of people of all colors, creeds and customs for all time,” according to Lord Stanley, Canada’s governor general from1888 to 1893. Stanley Park history set the tone for the way the city would evolve; deeply committed to the preservation of its natural resources.To best enjoy Stanley Park, try renting a bicycle at one of the many bike rental stores along the way. To walk the entire Stanley Park seawall it takes about two hours at a brisk pace, so don’t expect to be able to breeze through the park in a few minutes. Besides, there is so much to do and see in the park, you’ll want to take your time.There are a number of restaurants in Stanley Park where you can enjoy a delicious meal with a stunning view. Try afternoon tea at the Rose Garden or lunch at the scenic Sequoia Grill (formerly the Stanley Park Teahouse). The Fish House has delicious seafood in a beautiful heritage house. At the Prospect Point viewpoint there is a nice cafe. While touring around the park, make a stop at the totem poles, and plan some time to see the Vancouver Aquarium.View on downtown Vancouver from Stanley ParkIf you decide to tackle Stanley Park Vancouver on foot, the Translink bus system can make the distance between attractions much quicker. Look for the ‘’Stanley Park Shuttle’’ which runs on a fifteen-minute schedule daily from June through August. The bus makes fourteen stops around the park.Cruise ship docked in Vancouver PortCruising Port Metro VancouverAfter visiting Stanley Park, we found parking at the Vancouver Convention Centre. From there everything we planed to see was on a walking distance. For more than 30 years, the Port Metro Vancouver has been a leading homeport for Alaska cruises. The Port’s two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, are conveniently located and only 30 minutes away from the Vancouver International Airport. Canada Place is located in the city centre, close to shopping, dining, attractions, and Stanley Park. Ballantyne is located east of the city centre and close to Canada Place. The cruise terminals are modern, secure, and world-class.Port Metro VancouverThe Port welcomed 199 ship visits and more than 663,000 revenue passengers at its two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, which offer all the modern conveniences and services for a positive and safe cruise experience.The Capitan… my Captain!!Canada PlacePort Metro Vancouver’s premier cruise facility is located in the city centre, at 999 Canada Place near excellent hotels, shopping, dining, entertainment and attractions. Its distinctive white sail design, five-star hotel, and the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre make Canada Place an attractive start and finish to any cruise experience. When we walked through the Convention Centre, Aritzia clothing company, was having a ‘only once a year’ warehouse sale and swarms of shoppers hit this warehouse sale and were walking around with the Aritzia begs…Canada Place in VancouverBallantyneBallantyne, Port Metro Vancouver’s second cruise facility, is located at 851 Centennial Road, east of the city centre and just minutes away from Canada Place. The entire terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation in 1995, ensuring modern and efficient services to the cruise industry.Travellers to Ballantyne have access to Ballantyne Cruise Terminal via Clark Drive or McGill Street Overpass only. There is no access to travelers via Victoria Drive and Heatley Avenue.Historic GastownGateway to historic GastownAfter visiting port of Vancouver, we walked several blocks to Gastown. Gastown is where Vancouver originated from. The original part of Vancouver – Gastown – came about in 1867 after a man named “Gassy Jack”. Deighton opened up a saloon near a lumber mill in the area.Today Gastown itself is a cobble stoned regenerated area with shops as disparate as vintage outlets to the more tourist orientated stores. It’s also home to the world’s first steam powered clock, which can still be seen working to this day. It also has some great bars for a night out such as the Lamplighter, the Cork and Fin and the Salt Tasting Room.The most touristy spot is by this steam-powered clockBusy Gastown street with globe-shaped street lampsThe old-world charm of Gastown sits in the middle of the modern city of Vancouver. Gastown is recognized by its cobblestone roads and globe-shaped street lamps. This place has an interesting mix of historical sites, modern upscale housing, souvenir shops, art galleries, restaurants, boutiques and professional offices. Today Gastown has been designated as a heritage site.Busy streets in Gastown areaThere is a landmark in Gastown that is hard to miss. It is a steam-powered clock that sits on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. In 1977, Ray Saunders, a Canadian horologist, was commissioned by the city of Vancouver to build the steam clock to cover a steam grate. It was an honour to be able to have Ray showing me how the clock works. Today, the steam clock attracts thousands of visitors waiting to hear the whistle blow every quarter of an hour. It is also one of the most photographed landmarks in the city.Gastown HistoryEstablished the same year that Canada became a nation, Gastown grew into Canada’s third largest city and one of its most cosmopolitan. But the Gastown district today retains its historic charm, independent spirit and distinctiveness. There’s no mistaking Gastown for any other area of Vancouver, or of Canada for that matter.1867: The south shore of Burrard Inlet was a wilderness. Its only non-native settlement was a lumber mill where the owner didn’t allow alcohol on the premises.One September day, “Gassy Jack” Deighton arrived (he received his nickname because of his penchant for spinning tall tales and talking without end). He stepped ashore with a barrel of whiskey, telling the millworkers that if they’d build him a saloon, he’d serve them drinks. The saloon was up and running within a day…just across the property line of the mill. Gastown was born.1870: On March 1st, in order to give it a more distinguished name, Gastown was officially proclaimed to be “Granville”, after the British colonial secretary. But everybody in the rough and tumble settlement continued to call it Gastown.1886: Gastown was incorporated as the City of Vancouver, after British explorer, George Vancouver. That was April 6th. On June 13th, a brush-clearing fire got out of control and turned all but two of Vancouver’s 400 buildings to ashes.1920s: Gastown grew and prospered, as did the rest of the City of Vancouver. But good times couldn’t last forever.Depression Years: Gastown fell on hard times and deteriorated into a stereotypical skid road area until the 1960s.1960s: With talk of demolishing the area becoming more widespread, a group of dedicated citizens took it upon themselves to save Gastown’s distinctive architecture and character. The city rallied around them. Gastown was not just saved, it was reborn.1971: The provincial government declared Gastown an historic area, protecting its heritage buildings.This steam-powered clock sits on the corner of Cambie and Water StreetToday: Gastown is a refreshing mix of old and new, downhome and upscale, a place for tourists, Vancouver residents and office workers alike. Various shops have the streets buzzing during the day. A host of restaurants and nightspots keeps the area humming into the wee hours. And, more and more, Gastown is becoming home to permanent residents… just like in the old days.Gastown WebsiteWater St. CaféWater St. CaféGastown seems to be a perfect place to rest our tired touristy feet and find a place to sit and have a lunch. We picked the restaurant which is just across from the ‘Steam Clock’, at the intersection of Water Street and Cambie Street. We had no reservations but were lucky to get a table inside, with direct view of the famous Steam Clock. The Steam Clock is a big tourist attraction and it was interesting to watch other tourists stop at the Steam Clock to listen to the tunes the Clock plays on the quarter hour.We had good times at the Water St. CaféThe food at The Water Street Cafe was excellent. Our friends had the New York steak sandwich, my wife had the Forno Roasted chicken salad and I had Linguine Pesto with chicken pasta. Both were prepared to perfection. Service was a little slow but they were really busy. Highly recommended restaurant on a perfect spot.After lunch we walked down the Water Street. We’re in tourist territory here – right next to the steam clock – so you’re not going to find any bargain prices. But what you do want is some friendly service from people who seem like they care, and some decent food. This is what you get! There is also a good atmosphere which you won’t always get in these sorts of locations. Noticed several homeless people laying on the sidewalks… not a great picture especially for this touristy area!Best place to liveIt is impossible to see more that what we did in only two days. We used our time to the max and really like it. There are endless things to do in Vancouver. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery and nature or explore all that the city has to offer you. If you ever feel like you need a change of pace, you can always find something new to do.Vancouver scenic viewsWith its scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is known around the world as one of the best places to live and is a popular tourist attraction. Vancouver is also one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada with 52% of the population speaking a first language other than English.Vancouver has been host to many international conferences and events, including the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.I would like to thank our hosts for their hospitality. In return I hope they enjoyed this two days tour of Vancouver with us as much as we did! I’m sure we’ll be back to explore some more of this beautiful city!!","October 25, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:52:11.096674,2021-06-18 18:52:11.181476

Vancouver,,"A visit to Vancouver is a must if you are visiting B.C. See the cruise ships in Canada place, the sea planes taking off to Vancouver island. The transport system is great you can go anywhere within the area, by sky train or bus or take the sea bus to the north shore, where you have the attractions of Lonsdale key and surrounding park. From here you can get the bus to grouse mountain, where summer or winter there is plenty to see and do. There are further attractions from downtown Vancouver. Take a walk round gas town or take a trip to Granville island, and a visit to Stanley park is a must.I have never known a cheapest way to get to an international airport. From the airport to the train station in downtown is about a fiver for two with minimum walking. My son lives on the north shore so maybe I am slightly biased, but it is definitely a place to visit.","October 22, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:52:11.581911,2021-06-18 18:52:11.660630

A short break in Vancouver on the way home,,"At the beginning of Oct we stopped in Vancouver on our way back from Hawaii.  We spent 2 nights at Times Square Suites (reviewed separately) and it was excellent.Day 1We arrived on a Monday morning, totally zombified by our overnight flight.We grabbed a simple but well-priced breakfast at The Spot restaurant opposite to Times Square Suites.  It's a simple snack bar type place but breakfast was good and reasonably priced.  Service was excellent. To stay awake until our room was ready we hopped the Sky train and rode around for a bit.  Some nice views, cheap and a good way to stay awake.After checking in we had a short nap and then walked around the Robson-Denman area for a bit.For dinner we went looking for a great restaurant my husband and I had eaten at on our last trip to Vancouver - Darya on Pender at Denman.  Sadly Darya is no more and has been replaced by Zeitoon - which I will review here since TA does not seem to ""get"" that a city may have 2 restaurants with the same name and keeps sending me to a Zeitoon restaurant in NORTH VancouverZeitoon - located on Pender st at DenmanFood type - Persian.Sadly Zeitoon is NOT a good replacement for Darya.  It is a bit more upscale than Darya (which was VERY casual). The food at Zeitoon was excellent but the service was frankly the absolute worst.  Food - I loved the lamb and my husband loved his chicken kebab.  The rice was good and the veggies were good.  The hummus was just OK.Service: We received our menus promptly but then everything went downhill.  The restaurant was almost empty when we arrived yet we were ignored while staff - swept the floor???, played with the cash register and basically dawdled about.  It took 20 minutes before anyone checked to see if we would like ANYTHING (like maybe some water) to drink and finally ask if we were ready to give our orders.  The food arrived and of course one order was completely wrong - even though I had repeated my choice to the waitress SEVERAL times.  My companions were nearly done their meals and I was starving by the time I got my correct order. Basically if you are prepared to deal with incompetant and indifferent service, the food is good.Day 2We had breakfast at De Dutch Pannekoek House - a bit overpriced BUT delicious and the service was excellent.  We liked  it so much that we ate our final breakfast before the airport there.  I gather it's a local chain specializing in Dutch style pancakes (thin almost like a crepe).  They also had other breakfasty stuff - like Eggs Benedict.  But personally I would order on of the pancake specialties which are really good (and a wide variety of possibilities),We had a great day basically being driven around by a local friend (which is the way to go IF you only have a short time available.  We saw Stanley Park, Spanish Banks and Jericho and spent a wonderful couple of hours at the Museum of Anthropolgy (which for me is a serious must-do for anyone in Vancouver).  For Lunch we just grabbed a quick bit at the Cafe at MOA - really good soup.For dinner that night we went to Horizons Restaurant on Burnaby mountain.  The view alone makes it worth it.  The food is pricey BUT the fish was excellent and the service was excellent.Basically - absolutely worth it for a special dinner.Next day off to the airport.  It was a good break in what otherwise would have been a long and tedious trip home.","October 15, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:52:26.622707,2021-06-18 18:52:26.700482

It's An Enigma,,"I live in the eastern part of the USA, and had never been to Vancouver before.  Watching the Olympics had a positive effect on me, so on a trip to the Pacific Northwest, I wanted to make a point of visiting and exploring the city.  It was an interesting experience.Vancouver is a beautiful city up close, but stand about 20 feet back.  Ok, I'll explain--   If you're fairly close to the buildings, most of them are beautiful from the sidewalk.  The average price of a dwelling/house in Vancouver as of 2012 was 1.5 million dollars, so you see a lot of buildings that are landscaped beautifully.  However, I was a bit surprised that the city was not quite as clean as I had expected.  The sidewalks weren't much better than those in New York City, and Seattle was really much cleaner.Still, don't back up much further than 20 feet.  I hate to say this, but the architecture in Vancouver is not attractive at all, and would make a citizen of Chicago or San Francisco weep.  Nearly all of the high-rise condos that make up the city skyline seem to be made of similarly styled, gray poured concrete with large windows of greenish class.  Such windows necessitate that many residents must use some kind of window blinds in some windows.  The overall effect when you view the skyline during the day reminded me of the History Channel series ""Life After People.""  The buildings look like their depiction of abandoned high rises after several decades of neglect.  They look like skeletons of buildings-- Honest!Most of all, Vancouver is very, very expensive.  Meals, activities, real estate... it's simply unbelievable.  I guess it's fortunate that (according to more than one tour guide) there are many millionaires and billionaires residing in Vancouver.  The disproportionate number of ultra-expensive luxury sports cars certainly proved that point well enough for me.  Doubtless those folks find the necessities affordable enough.Mass transit is not very convenient for a visitor who doesn't know the system.  The bus system is excellent, but like all bus systems, it's complex and must be studied and learned.  The SkyTrain doesn't service some major sections of downtown, plus it has some truly bizarre quirks when it comes to using it.Wait- this all sounds like sour grapes, I know.  There is wonderful shopping (I guess) at every corner, and there are fun areas like Gastown and Granville Island to visit.  There's also Davie Street which has a Greenwich Village feel to it, along with hundreds of restaurants of every possible ethnicity.  Oh, and the green spaces (like Stanley Park) are magnificent.  A day at Grouse Mountain is only a bus ticket and about $100 away.  It's beautiful up there!Something that really helped was the two days of Hop-on, Hop-off double-decker bus tour that we did when we first arrived.  It helped us explore and appreciate a lot of the downtown area.Ultimately, I'm really glad I went.  I came to appreciate the fascinating history of the area and the amazing variety of food in Vancouver.  I'd recommend that you go and decide for yourself.  Still, make sure you have your wallet and plenty of room on your credit cards if you want a good experience!","October 5, 2012",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:53:08.724414,2021-06-18 18:53:08.805828

Lots of fancy cars and high end stores. The water and the green peeking out in the background. We felt safe walking day and night. It is remarkable the vision for this city. They rejected having a highway bisecting their city so that is why there is none in the heart of the city. Also, early on they encouraged vertical development so the city stayed fairly compact and they did not eat up prized properties such as Stanley Park. Vancouver is an example of a city that should be more closely studied and emulated by many other cities including my hometown.","October 1, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:53:23.776093,2021-06-18 18:53:23.854285

Rather it is a fabulous place to hang out, relax, stroll around neighborhoods, settle in to coffee shops, have some great food and enjoy the friendly Canadians.  It is beautiful, with beautiful Stanley Park in the middle of the city.  It is small enough that everything is walkable -- although some a very long walk.  Depending upon how long you stay, there are some very good side trips--to Victoria (which looks like Disney Land) or Whisler.  This is my 4th trip to Vancouver--whenever I am the vicinity I try to tack on a trip -- this time a weekend after an Alaskan cruise.  Once I connected through Vancouver going to Thailand so that I could stay on the way out and in.    I am on the East Coast of the US so it sometimes takes some planning but it is worth it.","September 19, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:54:04.062944,2021-06-18 18:54:04.140594

Beautiful But Lacking in Personality,,"Alright.  I was in Vancouver for one week and walked 70 miles and covered every area recommended by the locals.  First let me say this:Vancouver is a very beautiful city with top tier everything (which is why it is the most expensive city in North America and rated as one of the best cities to live in, in the world).  The public transit is state of the art.  The urban planning and walkability is among the best in the world.  The architecture, while modern, is excellent.  The parks are beautiful with lots of outdoor activities available.  The city is safe and clean, and a very tolerant multicultural melting pot, very mixed everywhere(it's not segregated like other cities).  This is perhaps its greatest strength...but it is also perhaps its greatest weakness as well.I really wanted to love Vancouver but I couldn't.  The reason for this, is that despite having everything listed above, I felt it lacked a culture or ideas that are unique to Vancouver.  It did not even feel like a Canadian city to me (I have been to the other big two) and I felt that if someone blindfolded me and dropped me off in Vancouver, I would have no idea what city I am in.  It felt like a West Coast American City (except with the Canadian hospitality) or a large Asia Pacific City.When you go to Montreal, you get the feel for the French Canadians by language, architecture, poutine, Montreal smoked beef etc.When you go to Toronto, you feel like you are in Canada with buildings such as the Hockey Hall of Fame, CN Tower, CBC, Eaton Center, etc.  It feels Canadian.With Vancouver, there was not anything I could really point to that is a product of Vancouver and I think that is due to the lack of any one culture having a dominating influence, which is why I said its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.With all that said, having been to many cities Vancouver is up there and would be a 5-star city if it had that identity I was looking for.A few cons: - Seems drug use is tolerated so you may get random whiffs of pot while walking- Some random whiffs of urine (more-so than other large cities I have visited or lived in)- Many bums/pan-handlers - more than Chicago which caught me by surprise","September 7, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:54:41.036825,2021-06-18 18:54:41.115757
Everything is walking distance,,The downtown area is very convenient and safe to walk around.  I would stay away from Granville street at night however if you are not used to homeless people.  I grew up in LA so I am used to seeing that.  Vancouver felt very safe to me but then again I am from a large city so your feelings on this matter may be different from mine.  I stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre and I got to explore the streets.  The downtown area offers a lot of things to do for all ages and different interests.  I took in the Taiwanfest festival they had going on.  Enjoyed the free concerts and performances.  The food at the festival was hit and miss but good for what it is.  Stanley park and granville island were also great places to vist.  Thanks for reading!,"September 7, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:54:41.115762,2021-06-18 18:54:41.197371

I can understand why it is ranked as the best city to live in...,,"i visited Vancouver many times, but i never really hang around in the downtown area.   In getting the SkyTrain ride experience, i sort of visited Vancouver downtown just for the sake of making a longer trip out of the SkyTrain visit.   I find that Vancouver city is no different from any North American city, but it is indeed one of the best urban planned city in the world.    the Robson street is a decent shopping street, but if you are hard core shoppers, you are better off visiting Toronto.    I dare to say that it would take at best 3-4 hours to check out the whole Vancouver downtown.  On the other hand, it is notable to indicate that i can understand why Vancouver is annually rated as one of the best city to live in because the downtown is not just a business town, but also a residential one.  Many people actually live in the condos in the downtown area.   I am much impressed by the urban planning however---there are not just bike lanes, but curbs and flower planters next to the bike lanes to separate the cars from the bikers.   it is a very avantgarde urban approach to encouraging more cycling and less driving.   I have to give Vancouver the credit for making their city cleverly green.","July 24, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:56:49.301756,2021-06-18 18:56:49.380512

Shopping is underground & above.. it's everywhere..watch for the ADDED 12% tax!..Transit in & out is good with buses & a toy train called 'Skytrain'..'toy' because it's a narrow guage track with little cars by big city standards.

Money saving tips,,"We loved downtown - we stayed right in the middle on Robson.  Vancouver can be expensive and one great money saver was the Entertainment book.  We used it for sightseeing and restaurants.  We easily saved a couple hundred dollars in a week.  We did not have a car and, at first, found the bus system a bit intimidating.  But we learned if we called the phone number on the bus sign they would route us wherever we needed to go!  This saved us a lot on car rental, taxis and parking.  We also signed up for Verizon's plus Canada plan.  You can sign up for a week, or however long you will be in Canada.  It costs about 50 cents a day ($15 for the month) and you remove it when you get back.  It really relieves the stress knowing you can call freely both within Canada and back to the US.

Same idea with the restaurants, more and more we walked and saw that this city was definitely up to par when it is considered as the best place to live on earth.However, it is a far cry from the east side of town, where we saw a lot of things that are hard to discuss here.

Great city,,"If you ever have the chance to visit British Columbia, make it a point to stop in Vancouver and head downtown. Vancouver is a beautiful city, lots of glass buildings, countless greens spaces scattered throughout the city...even on the rooftops! If you're into architecture, you'll see many old buildings that add charm and character of the city. Urbanists put a lot of thought in this one and it shows. We also found locals to be very friendly and polite. You can't help but feel like home in no time. Trivia:For all of you Smallville fans, many buildings in Vancouver have been used for exterior shots. The Marine Building (on Burrard street) is the famous Daily Planet tower. The building next to it (Government of Canada offices I believe) is Luthorcorp Plaza. A couple of blocks away you will find Oliver Queen's Clock Tower (Vancouver Block on Granville street) and a little north, the Sun tower (on Pender street) formally known as the Watchtower building in Smallville.","June 14, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:59:17.240094,2021-06-18 18:59:17.318258

I'm not a 'city' person but LOVE Vancouver Downtown.,,"We recently visited Canada from Australia and used Vancouver as our base between driving through the Rockies, cruising up the Inside Passage and popping down to Seattle for a couple of days. All-in-all we stayed in Vancouver on 3 occasions.Each time we walked and/or got the bus into Downtown. I loved Downtown. It is pleasant, easy to get around...walking is a pleasure and public transport is regular and prolific.There are a number of areas that homeless and disadvantaged people tend to congregate in the city. We did not feel unsafe although,as a woman, I may not feel entirely safe wandering in those areas on my own at night. The one day travel pass is excellent value for $9 and was much easier than trying to find the correct fare in coins for single trips. On one occasion I had had enough walking for the day but as we did not have the correct fare I ended up having to walk back to our hotel anyway.

They say that only the very rich and the homeless can afford to live there !!Public transport is so good that a car seems unnecessary - at least in Vancouver itself.  Vancouver is a coastal city, so it has beautiful beaches (including a beach just for dogs, as everybody seems to own one !) but it  also has easy access to mountains.

One of the great cities in the world,,"Just got back from a conference in Vancouver, and though I have visited many times, I was stunned by what the city has become.  Not just a ""city of glass,"" though the post-modern glass architecture of the last 20 years provides a soaring, glittering urban feel not found in many older cities, but a city that has found itself: a place that celebrates its multiculturalism rather than chafe under it and subtly displays its stunning physical beauty in ever more extraordinary ways.  The sea walk around the new convention centre is just about done, and on a glorious (though admittedly somewhat rare) warm, sunny May weekend, there can be no more gorgeous an urban experience than walking or biking around Stanley Park. The city's priority on biking, walking and public transit (the new Canada Line to the airport and Richmond almost makes hosting the Olympics worth it), despite some  grumbling, has meant the downtown has become more and more vibrant and alive.  Rivals Portland for North American urban planning excellence.  It is somewhat true, as a friend said, with housing prices so high only the rich and homeless can afford to live there, but in fact many of the high rise condos are rented by young professionals (in some neigbourhoods rental rates rates are 75% of occupancy) who turn the streets into a party on weekends.

"A clean, vibrant city",,"Vancouver is among the top places in the world to live. It reeks of money, and that itself is a problem- it just costs SO much to rent or own in Van.As well, it has the poorest ghetto in the country, disaffectionately known as the DTES (downtown east side)All that apart, there are great restaurants, stellar parks and seawalls for walking/biking/rollerblading.  The contemporary land use is exemplary- with live/work/play all in the same place as design goals. The transit system, for the size of city, is excellent, though there are complaints about night services, and holes in the network. The Skytrain to the airport means it is STUPID! to even consider renting a car or even taking the cab if going downtown.Chinatown, Gastown,Stanley Park, Granville Island (rent a kayak) are all big attractions- to which I would add the Anthropolgy museum at UBC, the Skyride up Grouse Mountain at night, and a visit to Lynn Valley and its suspension bridge. Free as opposed to expensive, as is the Capilano River counterpart. Also, Van Dusen Gardens, Queen Elizabeth Park, and the UBC horticultural gardens (especially rhododendron season) are high quality.

If you are staying downtown, there is plenty to do with the harbour right there, eating establishments are aplenty with a wide range of choices and prices you are willing to spend.  Granville Island, albeit crowded at times, has some great places to go see.  Just beware of a very small area on the Northeast side of downtown Vancouver that was very hard to drive through with unfortunate individuals looking for meals, many of which are dealing with drug addictions.

You can cirumnavigate the entire downtown core on a seawall footpath or easily criss cross on foot. One of my favourite things to do in Vancouver is to walk from Granville Island towards ScienceWorld then towards the Aquatic Centre to English Bay, around Stanley Park and then end up downtown for a nice refreshing pint of beer at the Alibi Room (great beer), Steamworks (great view and good beer) or Mahoneys at the Convention Centre (great view).

Concrete and a tid bit of jungle,,"Sine I live in New York City, and there are not that many trees, flowers, bushes, etc surrounding the buildings, it was a real pleasure walking through downtown Vancouver. Every building had tons of trees, bushes, flowers, what-have-you mixed in with the architecture of the buildings. From what I understand, the architects are encouraged and often asked to make sure that there is greenery intertwined in the production of the buildings so you get a nice balance of city and greenery. In addition, downtown was spotless. I could not find trash or debris even if I tried. Just a forewarning that if you drive through downtown, people drive a little on the crazy side and you will be hard pressed to find a left turn signal so you will get stuck in a bit of traffic. Save yourself the headache and leave the car where you are staying and take the SkyTrain or public transportation. For the buses remember to always have cash on you. For a lunch bite, you have to find this food truck, Feastro Bistro, they are usually located on Thurlow & Cordova. by the water with ample sitting space to enjoy your lunch. They were featured on Eat St. which airs on the Cooking Channel. When we planned this road trip, we had several food trucks in the different cities that we were going to hunt down. Feastro Bistro bar none has some of the best bistro food we have ever had. Please if you get anything, get the seafood chowder. I believe it is on limited availability. This truck only uses the freshest seafood, all free range organic chicken, beef and pork. All of their containers, etc, are biodegradable.","March 18, 2012",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:02:21.621912,2021-06-18 19:02:21.710111

"A tiny downtown for a ""world class"" city",,"It's amazing how small the downtown is in Vancouver!  However, it does have a nice small art gallery (rarely blockbuster shows, unfortunately). There are many lovely places to eat and shop.  Eating especially, since locals are fond of all different types of ""ethnic"" cuisine.  I love the Japanese restaurants like Gyoza King or Taku Guu best.    My favourite thing in the city is the seawall walk that can take you all around the city from Fairview/False Creek (which faces downtown), around Yaletown, the West End and Coal Harbour.  I think few North American cities are blessed wtih this really precious attribute.  People jog, walk, cycle and push babies in their prams on this amazing route!

The jay walkers all got cars,,"Vancouver used to be the jay-walk capitol of the world, but not any more. Unfortunately, the jay-walking idiots have been replaced by idiots that drive in this logging town like from they are in NJ or LA. Cars are a pain anyway, and with all the smoke-free areas its much easier sometimes to just walk or hop the skytrain subway system. The skytrain connects all kinds of places, and my favorites are the stops heading into Vancouver beginning with Chinatown to the end of the line at Waterfront. There are nice shopping malls there connected to the skytrain stations, making for effortless transportation (minus the week day, mid-day flakes that is). From waterfront you can catch the Sea Bus ferry to North Vancouver, which is great because the shopping there us fun, too.

Wonderful Walking City,,"If it is not raining, Vancouver is a great walkers’ city, and I love taking the time to look around me and, most importantly, up at the varying modern urban architecture. The whole city centre is walkable, and I wandered the streets at length, all the way down to Stanley Park. There, I rented a bike and cycled counter clockwise around Stanley Park. In the other direction, I wandered into Gastown then Chinatown and eventually into the most dubious part of town, along Hastings Street where hundreds of homeless people congregate. In the city centre, there are literally hundreds of eating possibilities, and some excellent sushi cafes. Lunch specials can be a real bargain, especially in more upmarket places. At no point did I feel in danger, though. For venturing further afield, the bus and underground rail system is surprisingly European-like, and user-friendly. The best way is to buy a book of 10 tickets, which gives a significant discount.","December 27, 2010",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:05:30.196859,2021-06-18 19:05:30.274651
Check out Gastown downtown - both charming and beautiful,,"I really enjoyed my stay in downtown Vancouver. We stayed in a hotel right in the heart of downtown, which gave us the perfect opportunity to walk to Stanley Park as well as visit the different locations in the city. Gastown was my favorite! The cobblestone streets and historic buildings made it my favorite place in downtown Vancouver. Steamworks Brewing Co. was the perfect place to enjoy a cold beer after spending the day on our feet.","October 12, 2010",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:05:30.274657,2021-06-18 19:05:30.351017
walkers dream but wear a raincoat,,"You can walk everywhere in D/T vanouver.  It is generally flat and the street run in an easy grid formation.  Start on Denman, make your way East into Chinatown.  Shopping is all over, not just on Robson and Granville and often there are little pockets of stores built into old character homes.  Get off of the main drags and wander.  There are no seriously unsafe places, you may feel uncomferatble but even on Main and Hastings you are as safe as Granville and Robson.  Some of the neatest stores are in the ""rougher"" areas, don't be scared off, they aren't really that rough at all.   Keep your head up and just keep walking if someone bothers you.  Make sure that you have a rain jacket though, the weather can turn on a dime and the only sure way to tell a tourist is if they have an umbrella.  The locals opt for gortex and a hood!","October 8, 2010",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 19:05:30.351023,2021-06-18 19:05:30.428246
your ads for canadian tourism are baffling,,"The ads for canadian tourism are both baffling, because one doesn't know what you are trying to say. Also they seem a little juvenile. Perhaps a little more substance would be in order. Margaret Kemp","June 5, 2009",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 19:05:43.542265,2021-06-18 19:05:43.636455
