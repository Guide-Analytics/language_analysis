Never get tired of this area,,"Tourists new to Vancouver should be sure to spend at least a few hours in this neighbourhood, which is anything but touristy. About ten minutes from downtown on the Skytrain, then walk a few blocks to the north. All of a sudden, funky shops, open air coffee shops and markets, people that look like they've never read a fashion magazine - great food, great coffee, great atmosphere. While there are some spots that have succumbed to gentrification, most of the neighbourhood remains as it was a generation ago. Enjoy it while you still can.","March 16, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 21:22:38.811123,2021-06-18 21:22:38.923557

Central Cultural St Italian quarters,,"Fun part of Vancouver. Definitely visit as it’s the central meeting point of the skytrain public transit line so easy to get off and back on with the same transfer. Home of the World Cup soccer games and parade. Tones of great eats and bars. A little rough around the edges still with homeless but not dangerous.

Great area to explore!,,"We have been to Vancouver numerous times but this was the first time it was on our radar.  We were concerned it would be too far away, but by taking the Sky Train, it is a piece of cake.  I don’t think I have ever seen seen so many intriguing restaurants of different countries and ethnicity ever!

What a dive,,"We grew up and lived in Greater Vancouver,  for nearly 60 years but haven’t re-visited this area for a few decades. We went on a Sunday afternoon expecting a clean, cool vibrant area a bit like Kits, and we quite surprised to find it more like East Cordova. A few street people laying on the sidewalk, grubby cafes ( I cringe at what the kitchens must look like )and second hand stores, tattoo parlours etc. People trying to to sell their wares in the park- looked mostly like dumpster pickins’. Plenty of piercings and tattoos to be seen, lots of...”unique folk”. We certainly wouldn’t want to eat anywhere there.

A neighbourhood!!,,"We are new to Vancouver and are still exploring.  We visited Commercial Drive expecting to be underwhelmed...what a pleasant surprise!!  This area has a real neighbourhood feel, with real houses, not a sea of concrete and high rise condos.  Eclectic mix of stores, restaurants, small markets, bakeries and coffee shops.  Nothing glitzy, upscale or swanky.  There are a few life style shops and clothing stores hinting at gentrification but most things are affordable and casual.

Funkiest Neighbourhood In Vancouver?,,"This little area, stretching a dozen blocks north of the Skytrain stations at Broadway, is a true distinct neighbourhood.

"Fiercely independent, a bit gritty, but genuinely East Van.",,"Commercial Drive spans the neighbourhoods of Grandview and Woodland, and is much like the main drag of small-city Anywhere, Canada.  You could make comparisons to Toronto's Leslieville, or even some neighbourhoods in London England.The unique feature of Commercial Drive is the lack of big box or chain stores.  This is an area where even MacDonald's failed to survive, though there is one Starbucks and a MacDonald's right beside the SkyTrain station at Commercial & Broadway.  The storefronts are mostlly housed in buildings that made up the original 1910 era urban landscape, though sadly this is changing with the increasing pressure to build bigger, taller, and glitzy structures that would ruin the cache of ""the Drive.""   Nearly all of the businesses are unique enterprises, dominated by a large number of restaurants.  You like to eat?  This is certainly the place to come, with probably the greatest variety of quality eats and local atmosphere to be found anywhere in Vancouver.How do you get there?   Caution--parking is limited, especially on weekends in the evening.  Solution?  Transit is easy from downtown Vancouver.  Take the Skytrain to Commercial / Broadway station.  There are some good eateries in the immediate area--Bandidas to the south, and Broadway Station Sushi to the west (see my reviews).   While you're at it, you might even take in a bit of entertainment at the famous Rio Theatre, a quirky bastion of East Van counter-culture.  Nearly are two pubs, Toby's and St. Augustine's (60 taps!  Great food!).   Generally, if you walk north from Broadway, you will be immersed in foodie heaven, with choices like Jam Jar (Lebanese) and Sweet Greek (recommended!).If you have time, you can spend hours ambling between Broadway and Venables, and maybe a bit farther.  Bomber Brewery on Adanac St. comes to mind, as does the new kid on the block, East Van Brewery on Venables.If visiting, you might want to arrive a bit before noon, and spend the whole afternoon drinking in the ambiance.It's always good to come hungry.

No major development, lots of old shop style merchants. If you can't find it on the drive it is probably not worth eating or drinking. It is an expensive area to have a home but the drive is just so Vancouver. Real people going about their lives, shopping for produce, cheese, baguettes, olives and wine.

"Kind of ok, but without much character",,"While I lived near this area for 6 months, I did most of my shopping in Commercial Drive, I could get most I needed so it was very useful. I was a bit surprised though how the locals said it was such a wonderful street. I mean, compared to any street back home in Amsterdam, it has no character. Barely there was any pleasantly looking architecture or nice looking feature (I had that feeling in most of Vancouver). Everything seems to have been built without any creativity or eye for quality. Everything seemed worn out, for example when you open a door of a shop, not rarely it feels very flimsy and you will hear the class ratteling in the frame. Quite laughable. The storage racks in shops often look like 30 years old. The ATM's which look like they were bought from some dump store in Korea (eventhough I used them, they didn't seem very trustworthy to me). Went to a couple of bars and restaurants, they were quite decent. Although, I always had to curb my humour with the staff. They seem to be overly polite and can take some jokes too personal. That didn't help much to improve the lack character of this street.I don't want to sound too negative though, if you are in Vancouver, you can probably get all you need in this street, just don't expect much beyond that.","December 17, 2015",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 21:25:53.994311,2021-06-18 21:25:54.081190

Edgy but Kool,,"Commercial used to be the backbone of the Italian and Portuguese communities in Vancouver, which have largely moved on although there are still several cafés, eateries and stores which cater to and carry their cultural products. It's best to stay on the main drag at night as there is a local youth gang which hangs out around the Skytrain Station at Broadway and Commercial, at the park 3 blocks North of First St, and in the neighborhood behind (West of) the park. When you reach Venables St, it's all bad on both sides down to the harbor and it's all residential so there is nothing to see or buy. Here are government subsidized projects and cheap housing where conditions exist which promotes restless kids and desperate acts. On Commercial itself you will find a harmonious and eclectic mixture of immigrant cultures offering everything from soup to nuts. There are stores of all kinds and extractions, restaurants, some notable but most not, cafés, boutiques, specialty shops, hippie food, services of all kinds, a regular Canadian neighborhood bar along with a dozen other fancy and semi fancy ""public alcohol dispensaries"", and a couple of legal marijuana ones, art galleries, fast foods galore, 2 pool halls, one fancy movie theater on Broadway at Commercial and anything else you might think of including an Italian Armory.

BUZZING WITH PEOPLE,,"The Commercial Drive I am reviewing is located between Broadway and about one kilometer south of 1st Avenue.   We stay near here whenever we visit Vancouver because our relatives live near here.  There are a lot of people walking around on the sidewalks most of the time -- people of many ethnic groups.   Most of The Drive consists of small businesses selling their products.   There are about ten food or grocery stores in this location -- mostly Mom and Pop operations.  Many advertise themselves as organic, and it seems like they are trying to ""out-organic"" each other.  (I myself do eat a lot of organic vegetables.)  There are also about at least a half dozen coffee shops in this vicinity.  I wouldn't make a special visit to  this area, but it's enjoyable to be part of the energy of the people there if you're nearby.","November 3, 2015",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 21:26:06.798705,2021-06-18 21:26:06.877490

Not really a tourist destination...,,"...Which is why I love it. For years I didn't get why people loved the drive so much, but that was because I lived and worked downtown. Moving out of the monoculture it still has taken a while to adjust. There are beggars. There are poor people. There are a fair few people who should probably not drink so early in the day and yes you can always smell someone smoking something 'fragrant'. But there is a fantastic community that lives and works together that is culturally, ethnically and socially diverse. That means you have a complete range of shops and services along the drive, and after a year there I am still discovering new gems all the time. Coming from London, it reminds me of Hackney in that sense. Not overly pretentious (you will find posers in all of Vancouver of course), it has a strong sense of heritage but not in a precious way - the Drive is constantly evolving. Come for great restaurants, fun bars with live music, excellent cheap grocery shopping and some fancy Italian coffee shops and ludicrously priced cheese emporiums.

At least one guy has a knife in his hands at all times- for the arts and crafts he sometimes carves, I'm sure.  Dope is openly sold outside the post office; convenient for some I suppose.On the other side of the coin are the Yuppie Hiptser types who thrive on the gluten free organic vegan paleo hand-picked by Tibetan virgins coffee shops and fishmongers who will tell you the name of the captain of the boat where this overpriced fish was caught, but I ramble.  If you're familiar with Vancouver, the Drive is kind of like Robson Street, with slightly less known brands (but the same high prices).  But hey, if people want to spend $32 (plus tax and tip) for a thin crust pizza who am I to be critical.Be careful if you're driving, as the denizens of this area tend to walk into traffic as is they're daring you to hit them.On the plus side, there are a few good takeaways and fruit and veg shops left, though I'd advise browsing them all to see which has the better prices or quality on any given day.Tacky, certainly.  Funky, maybe- but not cheap.","April 16, 2014",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 21:27:12.314774,2021-06-18 21:27:12.393639

"Love it here, but it grows on you..",,"So, I visited commercial drive for the first time in 2011, and I was indifferent to it.""WHY would I come here? Kensington Market (my current home) is SO MUCH COOLER.""In 2012, I found myself moving away from the Market in Toronto, and to Vancouver. It was really a coin toss between Kits and Commercial drive. We picked commercial drive because we wanted to be around the queer culture.Now, The Drive isn't somewhere I'd put on a ""must-see"" list if you're on a tight budget. You don't ""see"" the Drive like you would Kensington Market in Toronto, or some of the other neighbourhoods in Vancouver (like Kits). You ""experience"" The Drive.There's not much to ""see,"" but there's lots to experience.Grab a coffee in a cafe, and strike up a conversation with someone. Sit in the park, and join in on someone's jam session.Find someone you think looks cool in the park (""cool"" is subjective - this is one of the most diverse places I've ever been, and you will find someone who meets your unique brand of cool in gradview park). Tell anybody in the park that it's your first time on The Drive, and they'll probably let you hang out with them.Grab food from all over the world (which is notably absent in Vancover, compared to Toronto, in many other parts of the city).Walk around the streets, and check out the amazing backyard farms. Ask someone to show you around. They will.If you have time, spend at least 2-3 days here. If you are ""passing through,"" try chatting with some of the people who live here. Commercial drive isn't about the shops. Commercial drive is about the people, and not the places. here, you'll find young people, artists trying to make it, old people who have lived here for 60 years, people of all linguistic/cultural backgrounds, hippies, computer programers, lawyers, students, bank tellers...everybody. The one thing they all have in common is a love for this neighbourhood, and the desire to live a bit more communally. So, yeah, if you just walk around, you'll think it's awful here. I was bummed out when I first moved here, and walked around. I was unimpressed when I visited. But, now, I call this place home. Any tourist who has come to stay with us on the drive for more than a few days has been enchanted by it. Come visit us.

The essence of Vancouver,,"""The Drive"" ain't glam, but it represents a lot of what Vancouver REALLY is these days. Rain City is  more than Stanley Park, glass condo towers on the West End and spiffed-up tourist centres near the cruise ship terminal. Real people live here too, and Commercial is a good place to see a cross-section of them.It's grimy in spots -- one of the highest ratios of tattoos/piercings per pedestrian that you'll find in the city. Panhandlers, skateboarders, junkies -- they're all there. If you're lucky, you'll spot author Chris Walter, whose novels chronicle the lifestyles of the down-and-out. Look for a tall bald guy covered in tattoos -- Vancouver's version of Hunter S. Thompson. Buy a copy of one of his books in any of the bookstores on The Drive, if you can find them -- they sell out quick at the used bookstores. You'll find out about the things the tourist guides DON'T want you to know.The food scene is eclectically good. Commercial used to be the Italian district, and there is a lingering whiff of Italia there, but mostly the eateries are diverse, funky and cheap (for Vancouver.) Great grocery stores too, everything from Middle Eastern to health food. Hardware to head shops, you can buy most anything you want. True local hang out and shop here.

Funky little area with some great little restaurants and shops.,,"A formerly older, tired area on outskirts of Vancouver that has recently revived as a desirable residential area (older, worn Victorian homes being purchased and restored by today's younger families). A strong sense of community has given the area new life, along with interesting little shops and restaurants, some of which can compete with downtown Vancouver's finest. Lots of community events and colourful street fairs throughout the year make it a happening place to visit.","March 29, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 21:28:20.134225,2021-06-18 21:28:20.212126
Modern day hippie colony,,"Full of unique bars restaurants, Italian cafes and artsy shops. Second only to Chinatown for value and quality in fruits and vegetables ( because the wholesalers are just around the corner!). Some scuzzy types do inhabit the place mainly due to the overflow from the skytrain staion at Broadway and Commercial but if you ignore them, they ignore you. My favourite spot on the Drive is ""Belgian Fries"" one large serving does you for two meals , not bad for 10 bucks! Good Bike shops and  Musical instrument stores and a cracking good Pawn shop.. keep on going North and you'll hit the Vancouver East Cultural Centre on the left hand side.. some great shows here and then hit the bars afterwards.","March 17, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 21:28:31.341127,2021-06-18 21:28:31.442787
Culture!,,"This area of Vancouver has earned a special place in my heart. Without the pretence of Vancouver's westside, it still has the independently run cafes, restaurants, and pubs that make Vancouver so special. Be sure to visit the Rio theatre, Banditas, JJ Bean, Toby's, and St. Augustine's.

"""A taste of European flare""",,"This street has a European flare to it, in that most of the shops and restaurants are what you would see in Italy, or any other big city in Europe.  A lot of the delicaseas in Europe are located here, so park your car or better yet catch a bus over and just walk the entire street.You will also find that Commerical Drive has a large Lesbian influence so you will see women of all shapes and sizes from all over the world while going about your stroll.

A little rough around the edges but great anyway,,"The Drive is...well it's the Drive. It is/was Little Italy in Vancouver but has developed into it's own person so to speak. Great and unique and wonderful stores like Beckwomans, The Flower Box and Santa Barbaras market. These are the kind of shops that give the drive it's flavour and colour. The people are all come as you are and it's an amazing place to sit at one of the outside coffee bars and watch people.

All the interesting cafes have al the cool looking people sitting in them, having their cappucinos, their munchies and chatting with each other like you see on Friends. The lounges are full of local bands that plays great music that easily entertains you or if not, at least you have that excellent drink their bartenders whip up to make you enjoy the night away. Also, Commercial drive has an eclectic range of restaurant cuisines from Caribbean to Ethiopian, certainly enough to satiate any desire for a taste around the world.

Commercial Drive is Vancouver's Urban Village!,,"Great neighbourhood! This is the perfect fusion of a creative, bohemian neighbourhood and the atmosphere of an intimate, busy European city. You won't find any other neighbourhood in Vancouver with this kind of ethnic diversity. Savour every type of cuisine you can think of from classic Italian to asian fusion; from bistro fare with a cold draft beer to award-winning restaurants and fine wines. Commercial Drive is also one of the best examples of unique, single-location, owner-operated businesses you'll anywhere in North America. Places like JN&Z Deli, where you get Kolbasa that's made and smoked on the premises. Fratelli's Bakery (great Saint Honore); La Grotta del Formaggio (best cheese shop in the City); Lombardo's Pizza (award-winning pizza al forno); the list goes on...
