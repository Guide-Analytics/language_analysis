A Stroll Through Trendy Yaletown,,"I don’t tend to patronize Yaletown very often, which is kind of funny given the hotel I usually stay at is just a couple blocks away. Why is that, I wonder? I consider myself a foodie and history buff; thus, you’d think Yaletown would be a regular haunt of mine; however, it’s rarely on the itinerary whenever I’m in the city. Maybe I’ll have to work at changing that? After all, this neighbourhood is rife with history and remains home to some of Vancouver’s best restaurants. How could one resist that?From a geographic perspective, Yaletown is typically framed as being east of Homer Street, between Robson Street and False Creek (see my earlier reviews of both on this site). In that respect, Yaletown is a fairly compact neighbourhood, though it is quite densely populated thanks to the new-ish high rise towers along the waterfront. These rather pricey living spaces have unfortunately resulted in The Travel tagging Yaletown as “safe [but] snobby,” which I don’t think is a fair characterization because the neighbourhood certainly is NOT “snobby.” It’s chic and a little up-scale, yes, but remains just as friendly as other areas of Vancouver.One of the most significant things I appreciate about Yaletown is its history. In its infancy, it was primarily a warehouse district and shipping area for trains; in fact, it was once the Western terminus for the CP Railway. In the early 20th century, when rail started giving way to trucking, Yaletown remained in a sort of stasis until Expo ’86 arrived. When Vancouver played host to the World’s Fair, the waterfront along False Creek – including sections of Yaletown – housed many of the venues for this historic event. The Expo, then, not only improved Vancouver’s profile, but also provided the impetus for redeveloping and reimagining Yaletown.Indeed, it wasn’t long after the Expo concluded that Yaletown began to see something of resurgence. Many of the warehouses and brick edifices were transformed and re-purposed into office space, residential lofts, cafes and boutique shops. The restaurants, in particular, highlight this wonderful synthesis of the classic and the modern: Most are situated in redbrick warehouses that were built with exterior platforms originally used to load and unload trains. In the current day, these platforms now function as year-round patios. Personally, I love it when we can incorporate our history into the present so seamlessly!Speaking of restaurants, as already noted, Yaletown is home to some of Vancouver’s best:•   Blue Water Café (Was ranked #1 on TripAdvisor for the longest time, but still remains in the top 10. It’s also on my restaurant bucket list!)•   Bistro Sakana (An excellent sushi restaurant that specializes in aburi sushi. Very close in quality to Miku!)•   Cactus Club (Vancouver-based chain that needs no introduction. They have locations all over the place and are consistent across the board . . . also home to some of the most beautiful servers ;) haha. Some of you may get that reference)•   Grand Chinese Yaletown (Home to some great casual, and slightly upscale eats)•   The Keg (classic steakhouse)•   OEB Breakfast Company (Originating in Alberta, OEB is known for their unique breakfast/brunch options. Lobster crepe, anyone?)•   Bake49 (The double fromage cheesecake takes dessert to a whole new level!)There are a whole host of others, of course, so do take the time to amble about Yaletown before making your gastronomical selection!Beyond restaurants, Yaletown does offer a number of recreational activities. One could spend hours tootling about the brick walkways and taking pictures of the heritage structures, for example. Then there are also the boutique shops, which attract many. Or, if you want to escape the cityscape, Yaletown is also home to George Wainborn Park and David Lam Park, both of which run along the ever-popular Seawall, and provide lovely views of False Creek.Heritage meets modern, indeed. As I write these words, I feel inspired to visit this area more often. The living heritage is cool, but the restaurants are most enticing! Now, do yourself a favour and check out this “chic” neighbourhood and enjoy!","June 16, 2021",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 21:02:47.978390,2021-06-18 21:02:48.086085

Close (Just About) Everthing,,"Newcomers to Vancouver will find Yaletown a great base from which to visit many of the sights in downtown Vancouver.

Prime Real Estate,,"Yaletown is sort of like a big slice of pizza with the rounded edge of the crust being its frontage on False Creek.  Between False Creek itself and the soaring high rises are some delightful little parks (David Lam and Coopers); we especially liked the very pleasant walking trail along edge of False Creek's wall,Ferries run regularly across False Creek so commuters (and tourists) can easily get across False Creek from Yaletown.  There are Public Art displays and a cautionary reminder (blue stripes on bridges, poles, etc.) that forecast water level rises once global warming gets in full gear.The apex of that slice of pizza is (generally) Homer and Nelson.  The fantastic Roman Coliseum Public Library Plaza is near by and Yaletown is also very close to B.C. Place/Rogers Arena.  Yaletown has distinctive light post banners with their distinctive logo: a white maple leaf on a field of red.Since 1986, this has been an urban regeneration success story and it is now one of the most densely populated (and desirable) neighborhoods in Vancouver.  Those warehouses and industrial entities have been re-imagined into lofts, trendy restaurants and bars.  The face of Yaletown varies depending upon the different characteristics for the separate parts of Yaletown.","August 5, 2019",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 21:03:01.516031,2021-06-18 21:03:01.602960

The life of the night...if you have a ride back,,"I enjoyed my time here--the nightlife, the food, the bars, and the clubs. I would have given this place a solid five stars if it had a more efficient and accessible mode of transformation. I  was extremely shocked when I opened my Uber and Lyft app only to find out these two services were banned from Vancouver. I brought my own car to Canada but if you want to have a couple of drinks and cannot drive back you have to rely on public transportation. The way the transportation system works is you basically have to walk a while for you to reach a metro and or a bus station. Public transportation is not as abundant as you would see in cities like D.C., New York, or even Mexico City where you can find a metro station in almost every single block. This is very inconvenient when you simply want to call a car and go to your final destination without having to make transfers in the metro, take another bus, and walk additionally. I did try to call a cab, but the cabs are very expensive and can deny you service because your destination is out of their range of where they can drive. It's just absurd to me how a modern city can have a terrible transportation system.","November 30, 2018",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 21:03:13.135111,2021-06-18 21:03:13.216036
