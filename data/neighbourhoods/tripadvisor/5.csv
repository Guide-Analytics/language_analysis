Canada's Largest Chinatown,,"Ah, Chinatown! I think it’s quite timely for the penning of this review. The current and ongoing pandemic adds another complex layer to this historic neighbourhood. Once described as an area “humming busily for more than a century with vivid colours, exotic cuisine and a vibrant culture,” the Chinatown of today is more reminiscent of a deteriorating ghost town. The streets are dirty, souvenir shops have been reduced to 2, windows are boarded up, and the vacancy rate currently sits at an elevated 17%. While still not nearly as bad as Vancouver’s notorious Downtown Eastside, you’d probably be forgiven if you thought of the two neighborhoods as one and the same. They almost look it. Indeed, this “decline” has been happening for some time, but there can be little doubt that the COVID pandemic has accelerated and exasperated these sharp social cleavages.Vancouver’s Chinatown wasn’t always “void of life.” When it was established in 1885, the neighbourhood was a proverbial beehive of activity. Immigrants began settling here following the completion of the CPR in the late 1880s and immediately made Chinatown an important social, cultural and business hub. Evidence of this early prosperity can still be seen today in the many historic buildings that make up Chinatown. Consider the Sam Kee Building, which was built in 1913, and has been recognized as the narrowest commercial building in the world; or, even consider the Wing Sang Building, built in 1889, which functioned as an important early business space. There are, of course, many more notable structures that hint at Chinatown’s rich and complex history, but you get the point. In more contemporary times, the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden and International Village have done much to try and revitalize the area.I rarely patronize Chinatown; in fact, the last time I actively explored the area – outside of visits to the Cineplex at International Village – was back in 2011, and that was just to partake in the Chinatown Night Market (RIP since 2014). Thus, when I came by with my partner a few weeks ago, I was genuinely surprised by what I saw: A ghost town with hints of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. If it wasn’t for the phenomenal Phnom Penh, I doubt we would’ve made the journey. Well, the CHINATOWN neon lights and monument to the Chinese railroad workers is nice.It’s hard not to compare Vancouver’s Chinatown to Victoria’s. The latter may be much smaller, but it’s cleaner, more robust and safer. Try walking in Victoria’s Chinatown after dark and then do the same thing here in Vancouver and you’ll see what I mean.Interestingly, when I wrote about Victoria’s Chinatown, I lauded it as demonstrating “just how far we’ve all come” because we’d “shifted from discriminatory practices [. . .] to one of inclusion.” Oh how quickly a pandemic can erase that. Now the Asian community in Vancouver – and elsewhere – has to walk on eggshells because of ignorance. Chinatown’s “Millennium Gate,” which is a symbolic representation of the neighbourhood’s journey through time, aptly highlights this, having been vandalized a few times over the last year. I’m sure the negative sentiment contributes to the ghostly feel of Chinatown these days.If we can overlook the social and economic negativity, there are still some nice things to see in Chinatown: The classic architecture, heritage buildings and monuments are definitely worth a look. And then there’s the restaurant scene: Jade Dynasty, Phnom Penh, Virtuous Pie, Devil’s Elbow, Jam Café and Catfe are all superb (okay, Catfe is more about the cats than the cheap cookies!). Just come to this neighbourhood and view it within context. Doing so, I think, will result in a more positive experience!","April 7, 2021",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:09:08.477685,2021-06-19 08:09:08.592659

Chinatown needs a good cleaning.......,,"Chinatown is faced with a number of problems...a third of the frontages are closed....businesses are faced with exorbitant rents and taxes, the problems of the Downtown Eastside spill over into Chinatown, and I believe the city fathers(and mothers) honestly dont give a damn about the tourist areas of Chinatown and Gastown. Its almost like they want these areas to fail, so that the lowrises can be knocked down and highrises erected in their place. The Chinatown BIA should insist every shop/restaurant owner cleans their frontages daily, and the city should ensure the streets and alleyways are free of litter and detritus. The poor will always be with us, but they shouldnt have to live in filth either. The sidewalks of Chinatown need a good pressure wash, and the lamp standards(which are works of art) should be cleaned, repaired and painted where necessary. With a little TLC, Chinatown could be a great Vancouver tourist attraction again.","October 19, 2020",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:09:08.795827,2021-06-19 08:09:08.897631
Where is everybody?!?,,"One of the highlights of my trips into Vancouver is getting off the Skytrain a few stops early so I can walk through Chinatown. But the place was noticeably deserted on my most recent trip. Perhaps it's Covid, perhaps it's not tourist season, but talk about closed! Sun Yat-Sen Gardens (my favourite) only open limited hours. Museum and Archives closed and locked, people using the front steps to roll up their sleeping bags. Just two examples, I could give more. I hope this will change soon, but in the meantime, be sure to check websites, or phone your favourite restaurant or attraction before making the trip.","October 17, 2020",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:09:08.897640,2021-06-19 08:09:09.002781
What a sad state of affairs!,,"This was perhaps the most disappointing part of my visit to Vancouver.  I have never been to a Chinatown so void of life. On a Sunday afternoon, the streets of empty of foot traffic, most of the stores were either vacant or closed. While Chinatowns are often known for their less-than-sanitary conditions, the Vancouver Chinatown was disgustingly dirty and smelly. The smell of urine permeated the air and was repulsive. This was perhaps a great place in its prime, but now, Chinatown seems like an extension of notorious Downtown Eastside, albeit still a very mild version in comparison. I was thankful that I was walking through in broad daylight...I would not want to come here after dark. In comparison, the Chinatown in Victoria was far more charming. Even though it was much, much smaller, at least there was street life, and it was relatively clean, and most importantly, I did not feel unsafe there.","September 15, 2020",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:09:09.002788,2021-06-19 08:09:09.104139

"Really underrated, and safer than most suggest",,"I am a frequent Chinatown shopper, one who’s been going for quite a while now. Chinatown is chalk full of history and traditional Chinese culture you frankly don’t find anywhere else. The stores are fantastic, some of my favourites in the whole city, Ochi, Bamboo Village, The Tea Shop, there’s so many great small locally owned shops that will be a delight to anyone interested in traditional Chinese culture and products. All the store owners are fantastic and I enjoy speaking with them every time I visit. Chinatown does get a bad rap though and it’s a shame. I’ve been through here many times and haven’t experienced any issues, however some areas nearby Chinatown aren’t the safest to be in or walk through, so it’s best to stay around West Pender and the main areas. Aside from that I absolutely love it here, and I would highly recommend visiting whenever possible.","March 13, 2020",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:09:20.191727,2021-06-19 08:09:20.290999
Better places to go,,"Chinatown no longer has any good Chinese restaurants or many businesses at all. I used to come here often, now I go to other places like Crystal Mall, Golden Village or anywhere else in Vancouver for good Chinese food and products. Don’t let the name fool you, you will find better places to experience Chinese culture in hundreds of other places throughout Metro Vancouver. Also, it feels dangerous at night as it is in a poorer part of Vancouver. However, it does have a lot of Chinese-Canadian history, so that is the only real reason for visiting.","February 16, 2020",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:09:20.291005,2021-06-19 08:09:20.389495

Continues to get a bad rap,,"Walked through here on my favourite trek when I visit the big city: get off the train at Main Street, walk by Science World, through Chinatown, then WEST towatds the Stadium or Waterfrront Stations. What is important here is Chinatown's proximity to some of the scarier areas in the downtown eastside, so tourists are encouraged NOT to judge Chinatown itself by its surroundings. Consider the world's shallowest building, the traditional medicine shop, and the amazing Sun Yat-Sen Garden.

Amazing Chinatown,,"I recently had the opportunity to see Chinatown. I found it a unique and exciting visit  the stores had an abundance of items for me to check out. The people were very friendly and were happy to help me. Even the street people there were helpful in guiding me to certain stores. I have constantly heard all the bad things about how bad and dirty it is, about how it’s dangerous to visit the area but i am extremely happy i ignored that and went to see it for myself. Yes the area has some issues but so does every other place in the world. I have been travelling extensively my whole life and been to areas on this planet that makes it look tame by comparison. So my advice to anyone wanting to see Chinatown, but is deterred by the bad stigma attached to it. Ignore it all and go see for yourself to make your own judgement. I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised and will take away fond memories of the place.","December 17, 2019",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-19 08:09:20.784030,2021-06-19 08:09:20.880468

Chinatown IS cool,,"Everyone saying how scary Chinatown is, May not understand its potential to the full extent. Being around a couple junkies and homeless people rly isn’t a huge deal.

It’s fair to be more on edge in those areas, as it’s natural to have your instincts up around those we are conditioned to feel are more of a threat to us, but Chinatown is one of my favourite places in the city! Beautiful old buildings, cool local businesses (try to avoid businesses and company’s in the area that contribute to gentrification!), and delicious Chinese and Asian food.

We continue to walk in we could smell urine we thoughts this is not quite right, but continue a little further in and we knew that this is not good we decided to turn left to East Hasting street to Gastown. What a BIG BIG mistake, we were traveling with kids, we will walking into a horrified scene of drugs, needles, smelly urine, load of drug addict people lying and walking everywhere. It's almost the scene of a movie the walking dead! Because its day time we walking calming and as fast as possible. We manage to get out to Gastown.  Why are the government of Canada not doing anything about Chinatown and East Hasting street??? It completely outrageous to have this going on! I been to amazing chinatown in San Francisco, New York , Sydney, Melbourne, Houston & London. Vancouver government should be very much ashamed on them for not doing anything !!!

Somebody help this area,,"This is a very run down dirty area of Vancouver.  It needs a major face lift.  We were excited to walk into the area and find good Chinese food but the area was trashed and scattered with homeless crack heads.  In fact that is a huge problem in Vancouver.

Collusion?,,"What the hey Vancouver, BC!!! Do real estate developers have their hands deep down the pants of your city leaders,  planners and council members promising a “happy ending”? How are we supposed to read law enforcement ignoring the hundreds of drug addicted folks throughout the area shooting up, urinating and defecating in public? Has law enforcement been asked to ignore the area in hopes of driving tourism dollars out of Chinatown so hardworking Chinese have to give up and sell out? Take a lesson from your history books where you will remember you didn’t do such a great job with your indigenous people and asked yourself where this unbridled greed is leading to. It was sad to see the neglect being committed by your city leaders when it comes to maintaining the cultural jewel that Chinatown once was. I don’t blame this on law enforcement as they are instructed by city leaders. We saw zero police presence during our multi hour visit to this area and saw people openly shooting up on sidewalks.

I wished I hadn’t,,"For some reason it’s been very difficult find a Chinatown as good as the one in San Francisco. I also mustn’t have been asking google or Trip Advisor the right questions either, cause we wandered down there today totally unprepared for the sad state of affairs that is the Chinatown precinct of Vancouver. Just two streets over from the beautiful stores and cafes of the Gastown district lies the worst of tales to be told out of this city. Streets are lined with poor unfortunate folks, beggars, junkies, hustlers and hookers. The first warning signed were the street corner being hoses down where there was a large gathering of people with their possessions in carts, the smell of urine was overwhelming. I had my two adult children 22&24 with me and they we conceded for our safety. We saw people injecting, dealing, urinating and tripping out. At one stage two squad cars rocked up sirens blasting and someone’s day was about to get worse. We tagged along with a tour group figuring there was safety in numbers and hightailed it out as fast as we could. The whole scene was almost surreal and very very sad.

Avoid this area while in Vancouver,,"Reading about China town made me want to visit last week as I had visited China this past year. My daughter, her husband and I decided to check it out on our way to bike ride in Stanley Park. What a mistake....and our experience clouded our entire day. First, the streets smell of urine, so bad you have to hold your nose. A visit to Tim Hortons was a bust....the store was filthy dirty, we didn’t even bother to order. Tables were covered with garbage, floor the same, washroom out of service. Our saddest experience though was coming upon a fresh faced young girl, huddled in a door way shooting up, syringe still in her arm. This scene haunts us to this day. I wanted to say something so badly, and hugged my daughter a little tighter the rest of the trip.

This was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 2011,,"We walked the entire length of Chinatown on Pender Street while out exploring and going to visit the Botanical Gardens.  This is the biggest Chinatown in Canada and apparently ranks #2 behind San Francisco's Chinatown.   There was much to admire and appreciate here.The huge Millenium Entry Gate into Chinatown is a thing of beauty.  The red lampposts with gold dragons are so special; we admired the gracefulness of the curving figures.  Some of the historic buildings, like the Wing Sang building (1913) and the Cheng Wing (1926) are beautifully maintained.There was much that interested us, like the Sam Kee building, Shanghai Alley, and the beautiful memorial to soldiers and railroad laborers but its geographical boundaries cross over into the DTES (Downtown Eastside) which is ground zero for mental illness and drug use.  Since the 1980's, the Vancouver government instituted a policy of de-institutionalizing mental health care hospitalizations and they made their way here.  The zone for the DTES includes parts of Gastown as well as Chinatown.We stopped in at a street market while walking to Chinatown.  Nothing interested us but we did see a vendor selling marijuana baked goods but they were gluten free (that has to account for something).  A young woman on the sidewalk was being cuffed so paramedics could administer medical treatment to her.  Sometimes it is hard to look away.In San Francisco's Chinatown, the shops were more interesting and there seemed to be a flow out onto the street with sights, sounds, and (good) smells that we just didn't find here.

Thanks to Trip Advisor I modified my plans,,"Like many others on here I was going with guide book recommendations even though the Chinatown where I live is not at all what it perhaps once was. Anyway...I had decided to go to Gastown and wasn't super excited about that area, especially when seeing the obviously pregnant woman with fresh track marks shuffling along. It soon became clear to me that there is a grey area between Chinatown and Gastown, except for where stores are concerned - that's pretty black and white. Chinatown, with the exception of Hastings St., was just depressing but I didn't feel unsafe per se. Hastings St. - while I didn't go by it on foot I did see it from the car as a friend took me down there. That was just an open air market for drugs and stolen goods and I absolutely had no interest in exploring that.I think those that post on here saying they don't see what the issue is with Chinatown perhaps went around the gate and not much further. Because I have plenty of international travel experience and have been in all sorts of situations I can say that I can handle a lot.

Aside from Sun Yat Sen Park and a good dumpling place, there was nothing about this neighborhood that I enjoyed. One very unfortunate feature, which has nothing to do with the Chinese cultural presence, is that a couple of the main streets (e.g. Hastings) are thronged with homeless people, to the extent that it was difficult to navigate the sidewalks at times.

This being Canada there is no overt hostility but you can feel (and understand) the dislike for the tourist.  The City appears to have happily lifted its hands, allowing the rampant drug abuse and vapor-laden chaos to rule the streets. Vancouver is, I am realizing, as living demonstration that a city can be too liberal for its own good, and for the good of the people living there.

Great community!,,"I am really surprised by the poor reviews. I was thrilled to learn that Vancouver has one of the largest Chinatowns in N. America. Imagine my surprise when I saw all of these low ratings with references to drugs, homelessness, not being tourist-friendly (side note:  aren't us millennial travelers supposed to eschew touristy places and seek out ""authentic experiences""?)But that aside, the blatant racism and demand that an entire community put on a show for white tourists is disgusting. The reason that we have so many Chinatowns across the US is that in the mid-1800's, many Chinese people moved to the US to work on the US transcontinental railroad. The US loved this and even signed a treaty to bring more Chinese to the US. But then the economy in California faltered and who did we blame? The Chinese immigrants for taking our jobs (we love doing that in the US). Then we passed a bunch of laws to make it harder for them to be real citizens - they couldn't own property or marry non-Chinese people. Chinatowns were literally the only community they had. The fact that so many of them have become tourist destinations speaks to the strength and industriousness of these communities. But they don't exist for white tourists. They exist for the people who live in them and run businesses in them because until not that long ago, this was the only safe community where they could work. After WE brought them here to work for US (again, sound familiar?) And this doesn't actually matter, but I felt perfectly safe in Chinatown. I saw a few homeless people there. I also saw a few homeless people on Robson Street yesterday (one of the fanciest streets in Vancouver). I saw no drug use in Chinatown. I smelled pot all over Robson Street.

Vancouver Chinatown... I really tried to like it...but,,"We have visited many Chinatowns around the world, including the one in Victoria, BC.  While visiting Vancouver waterfront, we decided to walk through Chinatown, instead of taking the Rapid transit.  Whilst the Vancouver waterfront is pristine and devoid of what any city would consider ""unfavorable people"", later on, as we walked through Chinatown, we to came to the realization that ""perhaps"" the City of Vancouver may have swept all of  the homeless people to  Chinatown.  It seems so unfair.Chinatown is a living neighborhood and we saw old buildings and new modern ones. We walked past one of the homeless shelters.  The people loitering around were dirty, smelly and the stench of urine permeated the area.  Now I ask, if these homeless people have a shelter, why do they trash the neighborhood.  I almost rented a beautiful apartment through Airbnb, and because the reviews said that you would have to go past the smelly shelter to get to the flat, we decided not to rent the flat.

Poo on you,,"What is a Chinatown? Historically, little more than a ghetto. Chinese people created self-sustaining communities not to impress tourists but because their lives were considered peripheral. Not unlike the Jewish or African American ghettos, Chinatowns exist because of discrimination and racism. Your complaint about Chinatown changing says more about you than about the neighborhood.When a ghetto changes, it means the people who lived there prospered themselves and their families, pushed through and overcame racism, and then moved to the suburbs. Now they have more lucrative businesses than their grandparents had. And that pisses off some people because it also means no more Orientalized ""Chinatown."" The Other is out of the Ghetto. I have always loved Chinatown in Vancouver and am thrilled to see all the new businesses there: independent, fun, creative, progressive businesses. Haunts of the moment include the Keefer bar, the Union, and Kissa Tanto. Phnom Penh is as great as it was 20 years ago, and worth every minute of that wait in line.Change means moving the Other out of the ghetto and allowing the ghetto to become a living, breathing architectural testimonial of history. And it's a scrumptious area, visually. A few buildings have been modified to the point where you kind of wish they had preserved more, but as much as possible new construction is integrated into the traditional architecture. The Jack Chow building. The Sun Yat-Sen philosopher-scholar gardens. The herb shops, the produce stands.Urine-scented alleyways, grunge, grime, and maybe even a few goobers of old man spittle on the ground now share space with world class cocktail bars and experimental restaurants. I miss the $3 congee as much as the next person. I mean, now I have to take the Skytrain all the way to Richmond to get a fix of traditional Chinese food. Anyone angry with their experience in Vancouver Chinatown is either not all that interested in actual Chinese culture, or are just really sketched out by poor people. They came expecting an Oriental Chinatown, the Disney version. If that’s what you were hoping for, go to Epcot.For everyone else, see you at Matchstick during the day for a god shot of batch-roasted coffee. Then we can meet at the Union or Kissa Tanto for belly fills and cocktails. Or Phnom Penh if you don't mind waiting in line. Then if you're keen, we can catch a show up at the Rickshaw or lounge at the Keefer Bar. Change is good.","December 23, 2018",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:10:36.600352,2021-06-19 08:10:36.679466

Truly sad,,"After reading the numerous warnings about homeless people on Tripadvisor, we decided to visit with family including two younger kids.  Wanted to at least visit once and see for myself. My goodness, Vancouver's Chinatown is a really sad sight to see.  During our few hours there, we saw more homeless people and drug addicts than I've seen in my lifetime.  Witnessed several drug transactions, folks talking to themselves, and even a shoplifting incident between a store employee and homeless lady. And to top it off, we got a parking ticket for parking too long in the garage. Other Chinatowns such as San Francisco and New York are not anywhere close to Vancouver's seedy Chinatown. We should've avoided this place and so should you.  Very sad sight to see, I can't believe the city of Vancouver allows this to happen in a touristy spot.

There is also the Chinese Cultural Centre and the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Classical Chinese Garden and park to see. It's the largest Ming era-style Chinese gardens outside China. There are several indoor centres with shops on the 2nd and 3rd floors that are hard to get at due to bad signage and never-ending escalator repairs but once you find them, you'll feel like you've been thrown back to the 60's and 70's with the faded packages, corny pictures, odd selection of random merchandise (plastic pink shower caps next to cat teapots) and really cheap prices.  It's a fun day trip and you'll find lots of nice little bakeries and souvenir shops and plenty of inexpensive paper lanterns to hang around home.

I particularly enjoyed the photo displays depicting historic moments/events/people in the community's history. Though I'm American, I felt a sense of unity with the Chinese Canadians historically and contemporaneosly. Let's put it this way. New York City is made up of hundreds of ethnic neighborhoods. Who would dream of tearing these down? They give the city a character and sense of history and tradition as well as a resource for the present and future as nothing else can. Change is good but it shouldn't be accepted as a blank check for the future. As long as residents, immigrnts, business persons, and interested Canadian Chinese who so desire, have a say and hand in shaping, creating yet maintaining the history and character of Vancouver's Chinatown, I say keep Chinatown. I felt happy there,in a place where I felt I could relate, be accepted, belong.

Today we saw so many strange characters staggering all over the place, some in wheelchairs, some using canes, all under the influence of alcohol and other drugs.  I guess this is another example of you how can't go home again. Today Chinatown holds nothing of interest and is not a place to visit unless you are looking to buy drugs. It has been taken over by street people and drug addicts because this is where the social services are located.","August 4, 2017",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:12:06.086409,2021-06-19 08:12:06.165472

"Pretty big letdown, lifeless, least vibrant Chinatown we've seen",,"I grew up in NYC chinatown, and the one thing I can say is, its never been boring, weekday or weekend (fuggetaboutit). Thats why I was so looking forward to trip to V Chinatown. We walked from downtown to Chinatown. Cool stuff, the arch is lovely. I kept telling my wife, wait till we get there, just wait. We soon start seeing some Chinese stores, but every other storefront looks boarded up and vacant.. hmmm. There is a conspicuous lack of people, not just Asians, very few people on street at all. Some homeless folks shuffling around. We finally got the famous Floata restaurant for some dim sum which was ok, but my wife and I were the only folks under 50 there. It reminded me of a dying town, eking out its last few years in squalor/decay. We went to a few stores and struck by lack of merchandise and customers. Really disappointing. Contrast this with NYC or San Fran where you feel the hum and bustle and vibrant energy. Avoid unless you are really dying to see this sad spectacle. A block or two away from Chinatown and you hit a pretty horrific stretch of what seems to be a homeless/vagrant camp.

I am not sure if we wandered through a needle-exchange zone or what, but there were about 100 people from all walks of life concentrated on a small street corner and it was clear that these folks did not feel well. No violence, no threats, just a feeling of uneasiness. Caught this family of four (with 2 young kids) off guard. Would have appreciated some sort of ""warning"" I guess. Spent the next two hours explaining to my kids what we had just wandered through. The walk to Chinatown was not really worth it in hindsight.

(Like these users) the first time I've gone there, I missed the boarders of where to go and where China town ends and walked right into the bad neighborhood of Vancouver  (which is east hastings). If you want to have a fun time, you need to know where to go.  Make sure you always avoid northern main street and East Hastings. Stay between the edge of hastings and the park by Keefer street and you'll be fine. Then it's great. Many interesting shops, the garden is great and a nice mixture of city views and Chinese vibes.  Check out the spice stores and your senses will explode :) Keefer bar is nice for drinks afterwards. Try acme cafe for a great lunch!If you ever feel like you are in a weird area and it's losing the Asian charm, feel free to ask some locals for the way. Ps. Living in Vancouver has taught me how important it is to ""see junkies"" sometimes.  It's a City with many homeless and drug addicted people, because it's one of the most expensive cities to live in in the whole world. You can afford to take a trip here? Go to east hastings and learn how great you have it.  Seriously, I have not heard of any tourists being hurt in that area. Stay in a group, do it at daylight and be nice to the homeless and you'll see how these are just people in need. It's just part of the experience.

The area Vancouver wants to forget about,,It is sad that this historic area is so run down and desolate. You can literally tell where the city's modern development ends and Chinatown starts from the architecture - it is that stark. Several streets of shops and restaurants but you can barely tell the difference between the few which are still trading and those that have been closed for years.It is a real shame and - in global city terms - a black mark on Vancouver's otherwise great image. The whole place screams of poverty.Note -I wouldn't buy/eat from some of the local roast meat shops - many were serving cooked meats from one counter and then selling raw meats from an adjacent one! How does this pass any sane food safety procedure???,"January 1, 2017",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:12:55.247957,2021-06-19 08:12:55.351059
They deserve the present status!,,"Forty years ago when I first moved to Vancouver this Chinatown was the happening place for new immigrants. The longing for Chinese food drew us there. The shopkeepers, mostly from Toisan in Guangdong province, were busy and proud of their businesses. However they looked down on us new immigrants mainly because we didn't contribute to their cultural investment. You see, historically they went through a lot! Discrimination, molestation, alienation these Chinese suffered greatly from suppression by the WASPS!Give them the right therefore to be rude to newcomers. But newcomers speak with their pockets. So when alternatives popped up in Richmond and Burnaby, these newcomers disappeared from Chinatown. I was one of them. Today Chinatown in Vancouver is no longer Chinatown. There's nothing I can call Chinatown there. So, if you want to see Chinatown don't go there! You'll be disappointed. Instead go to Richmond where great food awaits you!","December 30, 2016",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:12:55.351064,2021-06-19 08:12:55.449262

Moderate Sized Chinatown; Moderately Scenic,,"I have visited Chinatown's in many, many cities in N. America, including the one in Victoria. I recently walked the length and breadth of Vancouver's old Chinatown (I say old, since many of the newest sleekest and swankiest buildings in Vancouver are also owned by the Chinese). Much is as in many other Chinatowns...specialty food shops catering to residents, trinket and gift shops and a number of locally owned businesses also catering to other Chinatown residents. This one was of moderate size, but overall, I found it somewhat unmemorable except for the Dr. Sun Yat Sen Chinese Garden area. That was very nice and perhaps unique...but the many blocks of sidewalk we traversed were of limited general interest, but relatively clean and felt overall pretty safe in the daytime.

To tell you the truth, I did not take note of the name because the food was less than mediocre. The fried rice was flavorless, the spring rolls were supposed to be pork but were filled with some kind of bad tasting meat mush. The pork ribs were mostly bone and fat.

A Great Day in Chinatown,,"We just returned from a terrific trip to Vancouver! I plan to post a trip report soon, but I really wanted to write this post today in case anyone was contemplating visiting Chinatown while in Vancouver. We actually really enjoyed our our guided trip to Chinatown! I highly recommend visiting Chinatown with a guide because you will view it  as so much more than a run down area.  We had just taken a terrific Granville Island walking tour with Erik through Tourguys.com (pay as you think it's worth type of tour) and decided to take a chance with the Tourguys two hour Chinatown tour. It was a terrific tour!  Erik, an award winning film producer of documentaries about British Columbia, led our tour and  he was so knowledgeable and interesting to listen to.  I could go on and on and about how great of a guide he was. The tour started in the middle of downtown, and we walked all the way to Chinatown. On the way to Chinatown we learned about Vancouver's history, architecture, murals, etc. Before we entered Chinatown, Erik explained the history of the area; it is not a history that the people of British Columbia are proud of  because Chinese were treated terribly and lived in horrible conditions.  I won't go into the detail here, but you can read about it online. As we walked through the Chinatown streets, Erik discussed Chinatown's present condition, its architecture, historic buildings/sculptures/people, etc. and what is being done to improve the area. During the tour, we were able to view the streets as areas of history and progress instead of viewing them only as a run down part of town. On the tour, we also walked through the serene the Dr. San Yat-Sun public park .  After the tour, we wish would've had enough time to visit the the Dr. San Yat-Sun private garden (for a fee) and the taken the guided tour.  Instead, with the little time we had left, we went to a restaurant Erik pointed out on the tour and enjoyed a take-out of delicious steamed buns and  apple turnovers.

"Nice arches, but that's about it",,"Currently, there is road construction happening in the area of Vancouver's downtown Chinatown. The stores are open during the construction.

One of the comments of the downtown Chinatown is that it is in an undesirable area. Yes, this is very true. However, take the time to perhaps take a guided historical walking tour. Here you will learn about the early days of Vancouver. Do take the time when you are in Chinatown to check out the narrowest commercial building in the world --- the Sam Kee building.

Chinatown tips,,"Chinatown has a very interesting history, but if you are not interested in history or old buildings you may find that there are not many shops or attractions to see. We do walking tours of Chinatown (vancouverwalks.com) and here are a few tips to get the most out of your walkabout. 1. do a bit of reading about 1911 Chinese revolution and Sun Yat Sen before visiting to understand why he is such a big deal in Chinatown.2. do not go on Monday during the winter because the Vancouver Chinese Cultural Center (VCCC) and Sun Yat Sen Park are closed3. do not go after 6 pm in the evening because most of the shops will be closed4. visit the VCCC if you can, both floors, it is free and interesting5. visit the Sun Yat Sen park, it is free but you will be charged for the Garden6. look in shops for things like unusual shark fins and lizard on a stick7. Bamboo Village has opium pipes and unusual things tucked away in the back (e.g. Chinese Army helmets)8. try some food, steamed bakery items are popular9. be aware of your surroundings, it is a non-violent neighborhood but there is a bit of property theft so keep an eye on your stuff10. you will be approached by panhandlers but if you just say ""no"" firmly then they will not trouble you further. If you give money to one of them you will likely be approached by others.11. afterwards take the Skytrain to Richmond from Chinatown Station and visit a mall to get the modern Chinatown experience","March 21, 2016",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:14:36.726744,2021-06-19 08:14:36.807537

Do a tour then explore Chinatown!,,"Did you know that Vancouver's Chinatown is the largest in Canada? Did you know that the red lamp posts within Chinatown designates Chinatown proper? Did you know that Chinatown is a tourist attraction and a thriving community? If you don't know all the answers, then I highly recommend taking a tour of the area and then exploring Chinatown with knowledge and insight. I recently enjoyed a tour of the area with Judy Lam Maxwell and her Historical Chinatown Tours. Please see her listing for more info or search Chinatown girl Vancouver.After the tour, I gained an appreciation for the area. It's past, present and future. I could view the buildings with greater architectural appreciation. Look at the neon with new found love. Enjoy the bakeries, BBQ pork shops, and fruit & veggie stores knowing that this is a working neighborhood full of history, culture and people. Walk into the herbal shop to smell the ginsing and admire the dried mushrooms and strange sea creatures.Yes, I noticed that many of the store fronts are empty. But I also noticed that the area is being revitalized. Developers are saving the Victorian buildings and turning them into galleries, businesses, nouveau restaurants, reclaimed furniture stores and more. Mixed in are the traditional souvenir shops and older Chinese people living in the community. There are social clubs and people's lives hidden behind the doorways. But how can you expect to learn if you are just walking around aimlessly? Knowledge is power people!In my opinion, Chinatown is colourful, clean and exciting. On a Sunday afternoon, I did not feel threatened or scared. I highly recommend walking along the main streets of Pender and Keefer. Explore the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Park (it's free) and pick up some fresh steamed buns from Maxim's. Enjoy the sound of the Chinese language and the people.

Devolution but still good,,"Vancouver’s Chinatown is the second largest in North America, after San Francisco’s iconic neighborhood comprised by those with Chinese ancestry. I had the good fortune to visit Vancouver 18 years ago, in 1997. The phenomenal growth throughout the rest of downtown in almost two decades astounded me. Skyscrapers next to English Bay remind me of Hong Kong. Visiting Chinatown was an easy walk from the Granville Street hotel. But that growth seems to have caused a demographic shift. Chinatown property owners resisted skyscraper development choosing instead to keep things the way they have been for decades: small buildings adjacent to sidewalks that border streets. Lack of development may have attracted the homeless and drug addicted population, though I saw that sad aspect only on side streets.  I advise enjoying Chinatown sights only on Main Street. Use the same sensibilities you would in any large city’s borderline community. NEVER wear gobs of jewelry and flash cash when traveling. Do you really need to impress anyone with a dozen credit cards or Rolex watch? A safety suggestion for any large city: If you feel threatened, walk into the street while checking for traffic. I did this on New York’s Park Avenue one evening.Our 39-member tour group of mostly elderly people (meaning we felt safe and were not bothered) had several stops in Chinatown during our 3-day stay in Vancouver, Chinatown’s Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden included. That Zen-like garden and the history we learned about how Chinese immigrants were instrumental to the development of the West Coast of Canada and America made me realize the mega cities lining the Pacific Ocean would not have occurred otherwise. Our tour included lunch at Jade Dynasty restaurant. I highly recommend the Dim Sum at Jade Dynasty. It was in Chinatown 18 years ago that I came across an idea: Use porcelain chopstick rests to place knives at a more formal dinner. I give a set of these to hosts when invited to dinner. Each host has appreciated the idea, and the tablecloth isn’t stained.","October 10, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:15:06.127748,2021-06-19 08:15:06.215388

Vancouver Chinatown was almost deserted, and scary, and weird. We were followed for a few blocks by someone clearly mentally ill, approached by pan handlers and saw very few people apart from those. I'm well traveled and rarely feel unsafe and uneasy - here I did. We found a Chinese restaurant with a couple of tables occupied and ate there, served by cheerless staff. Food was fine.

To get to the trendy Gastown on foot, especially if you're a lone woman, head west a few blocks first on Pender or Keefer, then turn north on Abbot, before you head north out of Chinatown. That way you avoid the edgier side of Hastings Street and can feel more comfortable. Chinatown is quiet on Sundays, so make sure to go other days of the week.

Small Yet Interesting Chinatown,,"We were disappointed that Chinatown was so small but we still found it interesting to walk around.  Reminded me of some of the other Chinatowns I saw in Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong but obviously a lot smaller.  Chinatowns throughout the world have cleanliness in the western sense as a secondary concern. I just like the authentic Chinese feeling I get in these locations and the feeling of the differences in the Chinese culture from our western culture.  This is one of the reasons I love to travel.  It's to experience these differences.  This Chinatown has easy parking and easy walking. Interesting shops, restaurants, tea shops and small Chinese grocery stores to wonder through.  There are some good restaurants and food stalls and a small Chinese botanical garden.  The afternoon is a good time to visit. Parking in metered parking along the street and some small pay parking lots are available.","October 15, 2014",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:16:53.061658,2021-06-19 08:16:53.159214

Not that Interesting,,"If you have never been to a ""Chinatown"" in a city, then this is probably worth a visit. On the other hand, if your have visited neighborhoods like this in other cities, you might want to give this one a pass. It has a small mall and lots of stores selling traditional Chinese items (herbal medicine, vegetables, fruit, etc) but it is not as dynamic as other cities. Apart from having the world's thinnest building (The Sam Kee building at 8 West Pender Street) and the Sunyat Sen Garden there is nothing remarkable about Vancouver's Chinatown. The neighborhood is isolated from the Gastown neighborhood by some pretty nasty streets that don't appear to be all that safe to walk through. There is a stop on the HoHo bus route if you really want to get off and look around.

Chinatown is dead!,,"All the negative feedbacks about Vancouver Chinatown are pretty accurate. Chinatown has lost its charm in last couple decades. Most of the shops are closed. The atmosphere is sad and pathetic to say the least. The only saving grace is perhaps the Dr Sun Yet-sen Classical Chinese Garden which was built for the EXPO 86, still the homeless and drug addicts would sneak in and take advantage of the bamboo shade and serenity to do their business. There isn't a decent Chinese restaurant other than cheap eat like Hon's Won Ton House and Kent Kitchen that you pick food items and pair up with rice, noddle etc. Avoid corner of Hastings and Main. Don't be fooled by its name as Carnegie Centre is where the local homeless, drug addicts, thieves, thugs etc gather outside. NEVER use the public washroom outside the Centre because it is a smelly hell hole. Drug addicts pass out on wet and dirty floor. 100 block East Hastings is the ugliest street in Vancouver. Despite real estate developers are trying to build apartments blocks in Chinatown this is not going to save the situation. NEVER park your car along 000-300 East Hastings even in broad daylight.

There are a handful of restaurants that look like they might be fun to try, but I have not sampled any of them.  On the plus side, I walk to Chinatown about once a week so that I can pick up some barbecued pork buns from one of the bakeries there.  On the weekend, there is a fair amount of activity, but most everything is locked up by 7 pm on weekday evenings. One unique feature is that there are more stores that sell dried whatever (fish, fungus, nuts, vegetables, mushrooms, anything you can imagine) than any other Chinatown that I have been in.  I walked around one block, that means 4 blocks of walking, and counted 10 stores filled with all kinds of dried stuff that all looked pretty much the same to me.

Like being inside a Zombie horror film,,"""They are scaring but not dangerous"" locals say. Do you want to see if that is true ? Dozens of homeless, drugadicts, mentally ill people. All of them together in few blocks. I was about to go by night ( a brochure carelessly advised to visit night market there ) Fortunatelly I read Trip advisors reveiews and decided to go during the day. Nobody tried to approach me but  it was more schocking that expected. So if you decide to go,  never by night, with no children,  and consider it a symphatetic experience about the other side  of a beautifull city.","July 13, 2014",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:17:36.651126,2021-06-19 08:17:36.732844

This is Chinatown? ???,,Having visited many of the Chinatown areas all over the world I was super excited to visit vancouvers one N we read that there was  a night market between 7-11 every Friday Saturday and Sunday . So we got there for about 730 for markets and Chinese dinner to be shocked!!!!! First of all everything was closed..... All of the bars/shops and restaurants! And no market!!! We later found out due to building work the market has been cancelled until finished which has should be another year....!! But I can honestly say it was a scarey experience visiting Chinatown with homeless drug users laying on the street/ hookers on street corners & a sense of danger in the air.We tried walk back to downtown vancouver but ended up on East Hastings street and this got even worse!!! Jumped on nearest bus to get out!  For anyone planning a visit to Chinatown and the reviews have not put you off then DO NOT visit at night.... Visit in the day and get a taxi in and out!,"July 7, 2014",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:17:36.812344,2021-06-19 08:17:37.095443
Larger than I expected...,,"I expected a two, three block Chinatown like the ones in Las Vegas or Portland, but this one was about six blocks by six blocks of Chinese faux architecture, with fruit and vegetable markets, restaurants, and herb apothecaries, tea shops, and the like.  It does not bustle, but people go about with tourists here and there.  There is the Sun Yat-Sen garden nearby, but Chinatown now seems more of a relic of a bygone era of the first Chinese wave of arrivals.  I can't vouch for any restaurants, but I did enjoy my walk around the area.  What was a little shocking is that one block north of Chinatown is Hastings Street, which is basically the skid row of Vancouver, the dregs and drugs of the city; strangely, it does not seem to affect Chinatown.","June 30, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:17:37.095448,2021-06-19 08:17:37.180886
Losing grounds,,"Vancouver's Chinatown used to be the destination for everything and anything Asian in the City. With the explosion of Asian-oriented stores in other parts of the City, and the growth of the Asian community in the City of Richmond immediately South, Chinatown has lost much of it shine. While it may still attract some visitors - it is within walking distance from Downtown - those looking for authentic and higher-quality Asian food and goods risk being disappointed.","June 25, 2014",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:17:37.180891,2021-06-19 08:17:37.261714
Edgy Ethnic Experience - A Walking tour of Chinatown by a Local,,"Full Disclosure: I am a Vancouverite of 22 years and have worked in Chinatown in the past.  I've walked these street many a time and eaten pretty much everywhere.If your idea of a tourist destination is 5 star hotels, fine dining and porter service take a pass on Chinatown but if you are the kind of person who wants likes adventure travel and want to see the real character of a historic place this is paydirt.Chinatown is a place in flux - has been for a while.  It is no longer the hub of ethnic life it once was since the Chinese have moved to the 'burbs like others who are upwardly mobile.  What is left is the physical memory of a refuge for Chinese who found themselves ostracized by broader Vancouver society.  Long since these dark and sad beginnings of the turn and early parts of the 20th Century, however, Chinatown is one of those places that has real character and the stones themselves tell stories.Geographically, to the north you find the poorest zip code in Canada.  Hastings street is not where bright-eyed tourists want to be as it is populated by drug dealers and stumblebums.  It is eye opening though.  The Carnegie Community Centre at Main and Hastings used to be the posh centre of Vancouver, but now it is the epicentre of a down and out neighbourhood.  To the west past Carral street you'll find gentrification and the sportsplexes of B.C. Stadium and Rogers Arena. There is a great Asian grocery store (T&T) at Abbott and Keefer as well as the International Village Mall near the skytrain. There is a skate park and playing field along Expo Blvd.  If you keep on expo going south you will reach Science World.To the south is Prior Street and it is the southern reaches of Chinatown.  There is a small Jimi Hendrix Shrine at Prior and Main. To the east is residential buildings.  It's not really worth wandering past Gore Street, aka, church row where the First United Church and Christ Church of China serve the neighbourhood.So where are the good spots?The Stroll: There are fruit and vegetable markets, fishmongers, butcher shops, pastry shops, apothecaries (go in and check out the dried lizards, seahorses etc.), tea shops up and down Keefer and Pender.  You would pretty much see everything by going down both streets between Abbot and Gore.  It looks like Chinatown and smells like Chinatown.  The buildings that will really bring you back to the day, however, is on Pender between Main & Columbia.  Just look up and it will take you back a hundred years to the ""tongs"" or family associations.  The Sun Yat San Gardens just a few steps further on Pender has a free walled garden area worth looking into and is quite nice.  You can pay to tour the garden house part of the site if you are so inclined.  Check out the narrowest building in Vancouver on Pender and Carral on your way to the Welcome Arch further down towards the west.  There is also a monument to the Chinese Canadian Soldiers who served in the Canadian military during the wars at Columbia and Keefer.  These guys paved the way for the Chinese to finally become citizens of Canada.The Food: Massive lunch Dim Sum place at the Floata (in the big building at Columbia and Keefer). If you like Asian style tea joints (serving fusion style western and Asian) hit up Maxim's (Keefer & Gore).  Try the beef tongue spaghetti.  Asian style diners are everywhere but I recommend Kam Gok Yuen (on Pender near Keefer).  My favourite, however, is the always busy Cambodian restaurant Pnom Penh on the southside of Georgia between Gore and Main.  I highly recommend their chicken wings, butter beef (rare beef smothered in cilantro, garlic & oil), beef on rice or lemon grass chicken on rice.  If you crave a western meal, Save on Meats is on Hastings and Meat & Bread just a bit beyond Chinatown - both are great!Chinatown is great for an edgy cultural experience.  Take a stroll and have a snack or some lunch!","June 21, 2014",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:17:37.261720,2021-06-19 08:17:37.342649

Better days are behind it,,"We had heard about Vancouver’s Chinatown and made a point to schedule time to walk there from our hotel. It was a bit of a walk and we were tired from exploring Canada Place, so we decided to drive there instead. We drove down Pender St and turned giddy when we saw the ornate gate with Oriental motifs. The giddiness turned to shock as we drove under the gate and further down the street. Many store fronts were closed; many seemed permanent. The streets and buildings look unkempt and only the occasional pedestrian could be seen. We decided not to stop and instead turned the car around… onto Hastings St. Not a smart move; this area which is a block away from Pender is most unsavory.There really is no reason to visit this Chinatown in its current state. It is sad that even the sizable Chinese population in Vancouver has moved to South Vancouver and Richmond. Hopefully the city and its denizens will recognize the potential this area has, and revitalize it. I’ve been to the Chinatowns in S.F., L.A., and N.Y.C., all kitschy but with vibrant communities.

The Night Market has relocated to Richmond, where is apparently where all the Asian business has gone to.  It's such a shame as there is so much history in this area, and it looks like the city is just letting it decline.  One block is being torn down to raise new multifloor apartments/condos, and that's probably what will happen to the entire area eventually!  It is sketchy in the area, but if you go during day hours and stay around the open businesses, it'll be fine.  There are still ""jewels"" there like the Sun Yat Sen Classical garden which we always love to visit.  And the Flota Restaurant & Hon Restaurant are still there.

Skeletal men who seemed to have trouble recognising if it was day or night with others only prevented from falling over by the building they were propped up against.It could be so different because we really liked the little clasical Chinese garden there while some of the craft areas were also worth a look.Sadly the main look being given was over your shoulder to make sure of personal safety and we didn't really relax until our Big Bus arrived to whisk us away to Gastown, an area claimed to have its own problems but which seemed like paradise when stacked up against Chinatown.In short, think twice before going there.","September 16, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:18:19.964318,2021-06-19 08:18:20.044992

A big disappointment,,"Having read the tourist information we had relatively high expectations of Chinatown.  Like a previous reviewer we visited Gas Town first before walking onto Chinatown.  The difference between the two is striking - Gas Town is clean, tidy and you feel safe as a tourist whereas by comparison Chinatown is dirty, tatty and feels anything but safe.  As we walked through it we passed a number of unsavoury characters sprawled on the floor.  We visited the Chinese Garden which was nice but after this we decided to leave and take the Sky Train back to Canada Place.  I would not recommend visiting, especially if travelling with a family.  We had thought of eating there one evening but after seeing it during the day will now not bother.","July 30, 2013",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:18:20.474953,2021-06-19 08:18:20.555184

It was a nice walk with a lot of history, but parts of Gastown and Chinatown were pretty rough and rundown with a lot of homeless looking characters moving around.

Not that bad,,"My experience here was nowhere near as bad as most of these reviews. I have lived in many Asian cities, so my expectations were tempered. First of all, this is not a ""touristy"" Chinatown. If that is what you are looking for, stay away. It is, however, what I would expect from an inner city working/small business area where many of the proprietors also live. It reminded me of out of the way areas in Hong Kong.  My main reason for going to this area was to find various Asian herbal medicines/remedies and tea. The Asian section of the city near whereI live (SeattIe) is expensive for these types of items. I was not disappointed in what I was able to find in Vancouver's Chinatown. Found all of the herbal medicines/remedies I was looking for and found loose leaf Pur-eh Tea prepackaged in a 1lb box from China at $6 CAD. That is an extremely reasonable price. The tea, when brewed, turned out to be good quality. In summary, if you are looking for the touristy, restaurant experience, this is not for you. If you know what you are looking for and are a bargain hunter, it is worth the trip.","July 15, 2013",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:18:30.621366,2021-06-19 08:18:30.700562

When we visit Vancouver, this is a MUST for us to eat dim sum at HON's and Maxim's for pastries (both across the street from each other).  We found Sundays are best to visit because it's less crowded and there is street parking close to where you want to be.

In other North American cities, Chinatowns are often dolled-up boutique shopping districts, or they're vibrant neighbourhoods offering the city's best Chinese food. This is not the case in Vancouver.Vancouver's Chinatown is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city. It's the face of Vancouver's first Chinese immigrants from the 1800's and it was here where they set up shop in the young city. As a result, Chinatown's a fantastic place if you're interested in Vancouver's early architecture. It's also a great place if you're looking for the more traditional Chinese culture. If you're looking for contemporary Chinese culture which is found elsewhere in Greater Vancouver, you will not find it as much in Chinatown. Vancouver's Chinatown also has a bit of a gritty edge to it. It exists because of its history, not for the sake of tourists. This can either add to the charm, or take away from it, depending on your expectations. It's a neat place to visit in the morning or afternoon as this is when the shops are open. There aren't that many fashion boutiques, but moreso the traditional Chinese markets, such as traditional Chinese medicine shops, Chinese kitchen supply shops, fresh produce shops, butcher shops selling BBQ duck in the window, dried good shops (like dried shrimp, fish, roots, and mushrooms in baskets on the sidewalk), bakeries selling almond cakes and BBQ pork buns, live seafood shops, and even the occasional ornamental shops, selling Oriental vases, statues, paper kites, etc. These shops are located along Pender Street, Main Street, and Keefer Street. Another attraction in Chinatown is the Dr. Sun Yat Sens Gardens - small, but beautiful classical Chinese gardens. The Chinese Cultural Centre is located here as well. While there are certainly Chinese restaurants in Vancouver's Chinatown, there are actually not as many as you may imagine. Because Vancouver's Chinese community are not confined to Chinatown, there are actually more Chinese restaurants outside of Chinatown than within. The best Chinese restaurants are scattered all over Vancouver, with only one or two located in Chinatown. Floata and Hon's spring to mind. In the evening, the shops in Chinatown are closed, and as a result, feels a bit like a ghost town. Even neighbouring Gastown feels like this and I would not recommend visiting either at this time. It's not that it's unsafe, it's just that it be rather unpleasant, especially if this is your first time in Vancouver's Chinatown.  One block over from Chinatown is a very run down part of Vancouver, and some of that ambiance spills over into Chinatown (and Gastown) at night. However, in the summertime, Chinatown hosts its annual night market on Keefer Street on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings. It's a small, traditional night market, but if you're in the area, it's worth visiting. This is really the only time of the year when Chinatown is nice to visit at night. While walking into Chinatown, the nicest way to get there is to walk W Pender, and not Hastings Street. Hastings is only one block north of Chinatown, but it's run down in that part and there would be nothing really to see on it anyway. The intersection of Main Street and Hastings is home to a large conglomerate of junkies, which can make a stroll to that intersection a bit unnerving. Hastings is a large street otherwise and is completely fine elsewhere in the city.Another way to get to Chinatown is to take the skytrain to the ""Stadium-Chinatown"" station as you'd only be a short walk away from the main gates at Pender Street.You do not need half a day to see Chinatown - only a few hours will do.  While I would not recommend visiting Chinatown for either a vibrant Chinese dining scene, an evening destination, or a contemporary shopping spree, if you appreciate architecture, traditional Chinese culture, and history, then it's certainly worth a look.","August 27, 2006",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:20:50.920089,2021-06-19 08:20:51.009212
Avoid it,,"I agree with peoples saying to stay away from this area.We were looking for a nice chinese dinner on a saturday night. All the stores are locked with fences and the few restaurant still open were looking dirty.We quickly noticed that no tourists were around, the local people were homeless, drug dealers or prostitutes.We tried to find a taxi but none were around. We followed a street cop to stay safe and we flew from there as quick as we could to Gastown... No chinese food that night.","August 21, 2006",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.009218,2021-06-19 08:20:51.092916
"If you like the Ghetto, you'll love Chinatown",,"I can not believe the city promotes Chinatown / Gastown as a tourist destination. They are both a sad joke on tourist that do not know any better. I would go as far to say it is negligent on the part of the city, and Vancouver should be held responsible for what happens to anyone that follows their advice and visits these areas.I can't say that I didn't see anything new or interesting. I got see someone smoke crack on the street, several strung out hookers (one getting dressed, one laying naked in an alley), a homeless guy with a bloody nose / face, countless beggers, etc....DO NOT GO.Gastown was much better, but after the trek from Chinatown I just wanted out.VANCOUVER, CLEAN IT UP OR STOP PROMOTING IT....","July 1, 2006",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.092921,2021-06-19 08:20:51.176992
Beware of Parts of Chinatown,,"I live in NYC and I am intimately familiar with the Chinatown in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn. I have also visted Chinatown in Boston, San Fran, and the two Chinatowns in Toronto.That being said, I am appalled at the parts of Chinatown in Vancouver.  There is a part of Chinatown taht is bustling with drug activity, homeless persons and prostitutes.  It's open and rampant.  I could not believe how many herds of drug users there were shooting up on the street, clearly visible to anyone who passes by, including the police who did nothing. I would not dare venture to this part of Chinatown at night.","June 8, 2006",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.176997,2021-06-19 08:20:51.256130
I enjoyed Chinatown,,"I walked around the main drag of Chinatown in Vancouver one Saturday afternoon.  I loved the diversity of this neighborhood, and I never once felt threatened by the ""beggars/homeless/drug dealers"" that other people described.  And I walked there, and from Chinatown to Gastown, without any problems.  I was warned by hotel staff to stay on a certain side of the neighborhood after dark, so there is some concern, but I already knew that Chinatown is not Robson Street.  I did not expect an upscale neighborhood, so maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed.  Quite the contrary!  I visited some touristy shops, a bulk grocery store (fascinating!), and peeked into Sun Yat-Sen garden.  It was raining and cold, and I still enjoyed myself.  I wish I could have found a restaurant and spent more time there.  Everyone I encountered was friendly.  An aware and informed traveler should have no problem in Chinatown.","April 14, 2006",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.256136,2021-06-19 08:20:51.337561
Chinatown is Great!,,"I'm not sure what Chinatown the others were talking about. Vancouver is a city like anywhere else. Homeless people are everywhere. Cities have bad areas that you can usually see a long way off. Wlaking blindly into a bad area is your fault.We PAY for parking in the ultra-secure, multilevel parking structure provided by the Chinatown people over the main shopping mall. Then we walk all around the blocks, staying in Chinatown. Hint - If the buildings are closed, with english writing on them and no crowds are shopping - You have left Chinatown. Open your eyes before crossing the street.If your car was broken into, it was not near a Chinese business. They actively push away loitering people from their storefronts, and groups of young chinese men follow them away. Why you would park on the street in ANY city when there are secure parking garages is beyond me. I bet that the valuables in your car and the damage was worth the $10 (Canadian) to park in a garage.","January 26, 2006",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.337567,2021-06-19 08:20:51.417763
Barely worth visiting,,"I went in Sept 2005 and agree with the other comments here. I walked from Gas Town - a mistake. The area is surrounded by the worst down at heel areas of Vancouver, filled with homeless people, beggars etc. It feels unsafe and is good to leave. Chinatown itself was very disappointing. I went towards the end of the afternoon, it was not very busy, there was not much there, and there were more Chinese restaurants in the City Centre.","October 15, 2005",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:51.417768,2021-06-19 08:20:51.714358
Do not walk to Chinatown!,,"Be careful when travelling to Chinatown. We tried to walk there from Gastown, what a mistake. Carral Street and the surrounding area is infested with homeless and drug addicts. We accidentally walked into the area to find ourselves near an alley with as many as 150, pouring out into the streets. Open drug deals were part of our experience, getting out without incedent a relief.We eventually drove into Chinatown, staying around Main/Pender Street area and about 4 surrounding blocks. Meter park somewhere on the main street! Homeless are still prevelant, just avoid them. Stick to San Francisco if you really want to see a better Chinese community.","October 5, 2005",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:21:01.791526,2021-06-19 08:21:01.885192
be careful!,,Quick trip thru Chinatown last month for Dim Sum and our parked car was broken into and everything that could be carried easily was taken.  Word to the wise....leave nothing of value in your car...even the trunk!,"September 9, 2004",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-19 08:21:01.885198,2021-06-19 08:21:01.975382
