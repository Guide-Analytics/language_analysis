If you can go on a weekday, it will be a lot easier. The weekends are packed with the locals, so the spots disappear quickly.

It is very difficult to access by car, and once on the island, navigating is scary and treacherous. I was sure I would hit a pedestrian, or be hit myself when we were on foot. We tried to park in a parkade only to find our vehicle was to large for the spot. The garage was so crammed, and the aisle so narrow, my spouse had to get out of the car so we could use every last millimeter of back-up space to turn around and leave. Eventually, we found a spot to park and started the adventure on foot. We checked out the children's mall, looked in the stores, fed the ducks, saw the small playgrounds. We squeezed through the crowds at the farmers market, visited some artisan stores and left. If we ever go back, it will be on foot and not on a long weekend.

There is a fuzzy warmth about visiting its myriad of shops filled to the brim with artistic touches while other shops sell everyday products born out of creativity and necessity. The indoor market is a treat to the eye and taste buds with products ranging from fruits and vegetables for amazing salads to the freshest seafoods to aromatic coffees to sinful cupcakes to handmade souvenirs from local artists (this is a gem rare these days...originality).

Of course, it is not a fault, but it should not be like this. The city is safe, clean and there are too many things to do or see. I wish we all had help to solve this homelessness epidemic.

1058,4 days to explore after Alaska Cruise,,"Went w another couple. Stayed at L'Hermitage Hotel. Excellent place to stay and worth the price! Very easy to walk around downtown and felt safe despite some homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks 🙁 also another big negative for me was how dirty the city was. Just so sad that they don't pick up the trash and empty the trash receptacles that are overflowing everywhere. And this was before the Gay Pride Parade and activities over the weekend. Sidewalks and streets need to be cleaned! That part was very disappointing. We went to Miku Japanese place and highly recommend it! Sushi melts in your mouth (the hot sushi - not kidding). Guys got the Wagyu steak and just loved it. Also got shrimp and Brussels sprouts for 2 appetizers. They were awesomely tasty!Enjoyed fantastic live music EVERY night at Fairmont Hotel in the bar. Good choice of bar munchies (a little pricey) and guitar musicians were just awesome!!Went up to the Vancouver Lookout tower. Price would have been worth it but with fire smoke couldn't see the beautiful mountains in distance. For lunch one day we ended up at this place called One Under. It's golf, beer and more. Great menu (healthy and not so) plus you get to swing golf clubs! You know when you try out clubs and hit into a screen? It's like that but set up like a bowling alley w about 8 diff screens. Can play a whole game but can't use your own clubs. It was an unexpected fun afternoon!Starbucks on every corner practically and nice shopping options you can walk to. The locals are very health conscious with a strong Asian influence on restaurants and food selection which I loved! But Americanized food available too. Locals are very friendly and I thought it was interesting that you don't hear horns honking like in most cities! 😊👍Also went to high end steakhouse - Gotham. It was good but not excellent. 3 stars as one steak was over cooked and our food took a really long time. Longer than others that arrived after us. But my filet was tasty and drink choices excellent. Had onion rings and another appetizer. They were good but nothing extra special. On your way back to US be sure to leave EXTRA time to get thru security and customs esp if you have am flight. It took us 1 hour and 30 min to get luggage checked and security, and customs. I was selected for extra screening but they were picking more to screen than not. Even staff member said OMG about the numbers! I really wanted to do the hop on hop off but our group wasn't up to do a lot of walking 🙁. Cabs very easy to get and reasonably priced. Overall I'm glad we stayed to explore Vancouver since we were all the way out there. I wouldn't make a trip out to see Vancouver specifically though.

1596,Not what you think!,,"I had heard that Vancouver was one of the most beautiful cities in the world so I was very excited to finally be able to visit. It was our embarkation point on a cruise to Alaska. The taxi ride from the airport was long & boring. Nothing particularly special. When we crossed the bridge & entered the downtown area I was surprised to find the buildings not so modern nor architecturally interesting. Blah & dirty. Our hotel was located across from the sports arena & other than that, not much of anything else. Walked to Chinatown just to be disappointed. No good restaurants or shopping. No comparison to San Fran, New York, London, Philly, etc.... Next stop, Yaletown. Walking from Chinatown to this area was safe but a little unsettling. The streets are filled with homeless people, garbage & very trashy. Frankly, I just didn't expect that. Yaletown was cool but a very small section of downtown Vancouver.

1613,What to do in Vancouver,,"Vancouver is a beautiful city...when it's not rainy and gloomy. The city itself is smaller than most major metro's around the world but there's still plenty to do. For restaurants and bars check out Yaletown; this small section of the city has great restaurants from mainstream food to chic and elegant spots including lounges. From Yaletown you can go and explore Granville St. which is the club district. It's lined by nightclubs and restaurants, the street however does get rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights. It's fairly safe with a lot of police presence but if you don't want to deal with drunks I would say away.Near Granville St. is Robson St. which lined by shops. Robson St. has lost some of it's past glory and isn't what it was 10 years ago as a lot of shops have closed down or moved to malls but it still worth checking out. Also on Robson St. is Pacific Centre mall. The mall went through a massive reno last year which included the opening of Nordstorms and other shops. If you want to buy high end luxury stuff you can check out Holt Renfrew which also went through a major reno this past summer and includes the first full Chanel store in Canada.Speaking of high end stores...you can also check out Alberni St. which is on the rear of the Shanghai-La hotel. This street has some high end retailers such as Prada, Burberry and Versace. It also have a few of the best restaurants in the city where a lot of locals and celebs. English Bay is a nice during hot summer nights, the views are amazing and you can catch yourself a nice sunset. Stanley Park and Lions Gate bridge are your typical must see places for Tourist. You can also walk the seawall from the Bayshore Hotel to Pan Pacific which is nice walk, not overly crowded and you get amazing water views. Las the but not least is Gastown.

2019,What I covered in 1 day,,"Tips:- Skytrain from YVR airport goes directly to downtown- Skytrain Pacific Center station is a mall, with lots of stores and a food court, a good starting point if you're not driving and thinking of shopping- Skytrain Waterfront station is a good starting point if you want to sight see (Canada place, Gas town)- Skytrain Yaletown Roundhouse is near False Creek where an aquabus can take you to Granville island (highly recommended), there are also bike rental shops here.- Gastown has the iconic Steam clock. The shops here usually sell artsy stuff. For tourists, there are cheap souvenir shops here.- Further down the road from Canada place is the Olympic torch and the Lego like whale sculpture. This place offers a great views. (Bring a sweater could get very windy)- I've seen some hop on hop off buses near Canada place and shuttles going to Whistler, don't know the prices though- There are cheap parking spaces, most impark lots have pretty reasonable rates.- Robson street and near it, is where most shopping stores are located at- East Hastings is where most of the homeless are (druggies are here, as i've been told)Pros:- Very accessible by Skytrain even from the YVR airport it all depends on what activity you want to do first- Very walkable city- Nice views especially near Canada place Waterfront area- Quiet compared to other Big city downtowns- unusually few cars but then again Skytrain gets you here rather quickly- it is common to see tourists holding cameras taking pictures, locals don't seem to mind- the sea breeze is very nice, i did a lot of deep breathing while near the waterCons:- Prices of items are more expensive if you compare them to United States- You get occassional homeless weirdos, I experienced one splashing water on my windshield then wiping it at a stoplight asking for cash.Although Vancouver downtown is great, I must say I still like Victoria more, it felt more safe and relaxed.

Once downtown we walked a few blocks to our hotel. Another three blocks down the hill was the waterfront. We only a day and half here - bit it is easily one of my favorite place to visit now. There is so much more to do in and around the area. Most of this downtown is small enough to walk (if you are a mobile person) and it easy to navigate. There are several restaurants on the waterfront streets and several more at hotels. There is a small underground 'shopping mall' area that features Purdy's Chocolates (YUM), a drugstore, gem/rocks/jewelry stores and more. There is also a small grocery downtown and a liquor store if you want a bottle of wine or Prosecco to enjoy later at your hotel for a special celebration. Prices were comparable to U.S. even for a downtown location - within a few dollars pending the brand. I was surprised to learn that Vancouver is the second largest port in North America. The skyline is really historic and modern at the same time. You can enjoy watching seaplanes (commuter planes) take off and land all day long from the waterfront area. The view of the mountains and bay was breathtaking. We felt safe strolling the downtown area during the day and through the evening. It was still dusk at 9 p.m. in May. This is a beautiful city with a great deal to offer. Downtown Vancouver does have several districts and we were in the business and gaslight district when walking. Some other areas farther away may not be as tourist friendly- not sure. We took advantage of the Hop on Hop off Trolley to visit the sights and picked it up at hour hotel. Travelled to Stanley Park for several hours, Granville Island, and all other downtown districts - including Chinatown.

2915,Nothing outstanding,,"For first-time visitors, it was a bit of a surprise how little the city had to offer. The transportation system is excellent - easy to use and gets you where you want to go. The views of the water and the mountains are pretty. The parks are pleasant for walking around, and lots of people were renting bicycles to take them in. The beaches were nice, if unremarkable.One problem is that the enormous number of highrise condos means there can be very little to see or do at street level. And while you can walk much of the city, you may not want to, as unpretentious shopping streets transition to homeless hangouts very quickly at times. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sheer number of down-on-their-luck or drug-addicted individuals is very sad. East Hastings was almost unbelievable. There wasn't much in the way of a downtown core - no central spot where you could soak in the city and its residents in a big public space. It also wasn't easy to see businesses where you could check out locally-produced clothing or jewelry or crafts, although you could buy Starbucks coffee just about anywhere. Granville Street and Robson Street had few options for tourists, and Granville was slightly off-putting for the number of people huddled in empty storefronts and slouched on the street, although it didn't feel especially dangerous, and nearby roads that ran parallel were much quieter options if needed. The Yaletown district had a few streets of restaurants, but again, not much reason to walk around. The Sun Yat Sen garden is worth a look, but much of the city seemed to involve knowing exactly where you wanted to go or what you wanted to see, rather than walking around and being surprised by charming finds. Other areas, like Kitsilano, delivered on charm, but downtown Vancouver had much less than you might expect for a city of its size.","August 2, 2015",0,0,,2.0,2021-06-18 18:19:08.719901,2021-06-18 18:19:08.801210,"Granville Street and Robson Street had few options for tourists, and Granville was slightly off-putting for the number of people huddled in empty storefronts and slouched on the street, although it didn't feel especially dangerous, and nearby roads that ran parallel were much quieter options if needed.","Granville was slightly off-putting for the number of people huddled in empty storefronts and slouched on the street, although it didn't feel especially dangerous",-0.9993403553962708,safety,dangerous

The taxi driver told us it is a great city, safe to walk day or night, even down alleys. The driver we had for our one tour told us the exact same thing. One thing I noticed unlike other larger cities is the lack of graffiti, which is a nice thing. There is something for everyone in this city from small boutiques, touristy gifts to high end shopping. There is also every kind of food imaginable here and walking down some streets the smell of curry, or charbroilers really filled the air.

There are wonderful views if you are anywhere near the harbour, there are nice beaches (English Bay, Sunset, Second and Third Beaches), and Stanley park.

I would exclude from this last comment much of the area east of Carrall street (at the eastern end of Gastown). There are also many very good restaurants. Even with all this, I would still rate Vancouver's downtown as average in and of itself. It lacks the excitement and variety of Manhattan, Tokyo, London or Paris; other than a few buildings such as the courthouse, the architecture is rather pedestrian. The arts scene in Vancouver has taken several hits over the years with the closure of the Queen Elizabeth Playhouse, the disappearance of decent jazz bars in the city and I think even the Yale Hotel has closed its doors (the neon sign outside still advertises ""Live Blues Nightly"").So while there are many good restaurants downtown, and many good attractions in the downtown area, the idea of downtown being one of them just doesn't quite work.","May 22, 2015",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 18:24:01.646710,2021-06-18 18:24:01.859344,"The West End, Central Business District and Yaletown are all pretty safe for a walkabout.",are all pretty safe for a walkabout,0.9865314364433289,safety,safe

It has a wonderful location with stunning views along the waterfront. Public transportation was fairly easy to maneuver (especially due to the kindness of the locals who offered guidance when we were looking a little confused in the tunnels leading to the train station), parking was not difficult and the many people we met while in Vancouver were kind, warm and friendly - we found them very helpful on several occasions. Utilize the visitor's center as they have many suggestions and offer some discounted tickets for area attractions. The business district and waterfront district are very clean and safe. There were many places to eat or grab a cup of coffee and the shopping was plentiful, if that's your thing. Canada Place has lots to do with some fun attractions and the area near the Olympic Cauldron was a wonderful spot with wooden lounging chairs overlooking the water, access to the pathway running along the water, more restaurants etc. I must admit we did run into a few beggars once we were on the fringe of this waterfront area and the homelessness in the China town area was very sad and made for a stark contrast between the haves and have nots with just a couple of blocks in between, heartbreaking for sure....

I walked it and drove around in it and never had any problems with either. Driving made me a little nervous because the lanes just seem so narrow but we were fine. There are a lot of homeless people everywhere and drug use is obvious but I never felt unsafe. I've been in cities all over the world and despite what we saw here, this was one of the safest feeling cities we've ever been in. We explored miles and miles of Vancouver on foot and I wouldn't hesitate to do so again (like anywhere - just use your common sense.) We saw plenty of officers in marked and unmarked cars. We sat in the parks and only twice were we approached by people begging. The first time it happened the man was so polite we did help him with a little something. The second time I couldn't understand what he was saying (it was French) and told him to move on which he did. Some people stopped and just started telling us stories out of the blue while we were on the street. They were all very entertaining and after we said something like ""oh, that's nice"" they went on their way. Vancouver is a very busy city. There is always something going on. I am already looking forward to going back.","July 30, 2014",0,0,,5.0,2021-06-18 18:34:19.953318,2021-06-18 18:34:20.032523,but I never felt unsafe.,felt unsafe,0.9808633327484131,safety,unsafe

The street is mainly inhabited by people who has drug addicts and homesless people but it is completely a safe place to visit. They dont really care about your existence. If you are worried of safety then i suggest not to visit. Downtown vancouver itself is pretty small, you only need about 3 days to complete the whole tour. I dont encoourage anyone to use the big bus tour because it is way too expensive. Its one of those cities that you won't miss out a lot even if you don't visit.

4482,Vancouver highlights,,"Long weekend in Vancouver (BC)As the Labour Day holiday was approaching this year, Vera and I were making plans how to spend this long weekend in neighboring province of British Columbia. Our plan was to drive there and visit our friends in Langley (BC) and we also wanted to finally tour the city of Vancouver. I knew, it was going to be a long drive, but I like driving so off we went on Friday morning (I had an extra day off from work) via Jasper and Kamloops on this 1000 km journey through western Canada.Vancouver was our destination for this journeyHighway journeyWe took Yellowhead highway 16 to Jasper and continued (without stopping) on highway 5 through Valemount and Clearwater, all the way down to Kamloops. We then continued down Highway 5 (the Coquihalla Highway) down through Merritt and Hope to Chilliwack. Some say this road is a toll road, but we didn't have to pay for this road (Sep 2012). It is a good, double lane road, though. From Chilliwack I drove on the highway 1 straight towards Vancouver and took exit for Langley.We arrived in Langley before dusk and our friends were happy to welcome us with a glass of home made vine at their newly renovated house. We discussed our plans for the next day and went to bed early, so that we'll be well rested for the long touristy day in Vancouver.Sea-to-Sky HighwayLangley is a short 45 minutes drive from Vancouver and we made to the city by avoiding the busy highway 5 where there are always traffic issues. Instead we used the ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"", which is actually highway 99. This highway travels along the scenic Pacific Ocean vistas, bustling communities and parks. Smooth moving traffic at the times we've been on it. The ""Sea-to-Sky Highway"" is the name given to the section of Highway 99 starting just north of Horseshoe Bay. From Horseshoe Bay, the highway travels along the coast of Howe Sound for 12 km to Lions Bay, north for another 21 km to Britannia Beach, and further north for 11 more km to Squamish, at the head of Howe Sound. We left the highway once we reached the city as we were heading towards the North Vancouver. We wanted to visit well known tourist attraction 'Capilano Suspension bridge'.Arial view of VancouverVancouver CityWe've been in Vancouver previously, but never had time to be a real tourists and see the city from that perspective. Here is my short story and how it went this time...Our 2-day itinerary of Vancouver began in Vancouver's North Shore where we visited Capilano Suspension bridge. From there we went into Stanley park and stopped at the downtown peninsula in the heart of the city to walk the Vancouver's Port Metro and Gastown area. All those spots provided a small glimpse of what makes Vancouver Canada's most beautiful city.Vancouver Yacht clubVancouver is, after all, one of the cities that routinely tops those lists of the world's greatest places to live. But beyond the breathtaking snowcapped crags, city-hugging beaches and dense waterfront forests lies a comparatively young metropolis that's still trying to discover its true identity - less than 150 years after a 'gassy' Englishman rowed in and kicked it all off with a makeshift pub.Arial view of Vancouver harborCapilano Suspension bridgeYeah, it's a tourist trap but I like to be a super tourist and do touristy things when I travel. At $34 a pop to enter it is not cheap. Food is expensive in the park but you get a free poncho if it might rain... lol! It didn't when we were there... instead we had a great weather! It's a great look at nature for someone from the big city like us.Capilano Suspension bridgeThe park itself is quite scenic and has some interesting activities: network of short suspension bridges between trees, a semicircular bridge jutting out from a cliff, some cool informative displays, and of course the Capilano bridge. But on a weekend it was full of tourists, who thought nothing of holding up everyone behind them to get several shots of their kids with no one else in the frame. That made it for very slow bridge crossing. If you're sensitive to heights and bridge swinging, you shouldn't go.Swinging Capilano Suspension bridgeSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffSemicircular bridge jutting out from a cliffThere are no true hiking trails, and the park is not very big, you will cover all the ground in about 90 minutes. I would say it would be worth it for ~$15, but the fee is extortionate and a true nature lover would be better served elsewhere. I can see how it is great for families or people looking for a manageable nature walk. If you do go, take your time and explore everything, the views throughout are lovely.Network of short suspension bridges between treesCurrent admission to the bridge is $34 for adults, $27 for teens, and $12 for kids 6-12. We could go free to Lynn Canyon. What do I think beauty is worth? Can I afford this much money for this one attraction though? You could argue there are more bridges and things to see at Capilano, but the thrill of crossing a suspension bridge was the experience we were looking for. Going to the free, public Lynn Canyon bridge would fit the bill just fine... perfectly even. So, next time I'll go there...Capilano Bridge HistoryIt was about 1890 that George Mackay discovered the spot, where Capliano Suspension Bridge now stands. Impressed by the beauty of the land, he built a cabin for himself and his wife. Then, with the help of local natives and a team of horses, he pulled taut the first cedar plank and hemp rope bridge 450 feet across and 230 feet above Capilano River.Mackay's friends began their journey to the bridge by crossing Burrard Inlet abroad the S.S. Senator. A long trek up the rough trail that is new Capilano Road led to their being dubbed, Capilano Tramps. The encumbrances of their dress did little to deter the spirited adventurers, who steadily visited the bridge. It was such a popular attraction that a second, and more secure, wire bridge was built in 1903. Another wire bridge, with both cable ends firmly encased in concrete, was built in 1914.In 1911, the Tea House (now the Trading Post) was built on the edge of Capilano Canyon. Later, during 1930s, bridge owner, Mac MacEachran, initiated the tradition of inviting local natives to place their totem poles on the grounds. The totems, you see here today, are maintained in the exact condition, in which they were received about 1940. This is unlike many of the poles, you may see elsewhere, which have been allowed to deteriorate with the passage of time.At the end of cliff walksBeautiful scenic canyon deep down under the bridgeDuring this 1930's Depression, two Danish carvers, Aage Madsen and Karl Hansen, arrived at the Bridge to sell their craft. In return for provisions and shelter in a small shack, on the far side of the Canyon, they carved the life sized native Indian statues that are scattered throughout the Park. The European perception of natives is apparent in the Plains Indian attire of the figures.The only exception is the carving of Mary Capilano, who is dressed in typical West Coast fashion with papoose Mathias Joe Capilano on her back. Mary was the only local native the two carvers had actually met.In 1956, the present bridge was built. This time the pre-stressed wire cables were encased in 13 tons of concrete at either end.Several attractions have been added to the Park in 1990s, including The Story Center and Living Forest Exhibits, the cantilevered deck along the Canyon edge, the big house native carving center, the Pioneer Garden and the Loggers' Grill...Stanley ParkLook at an aerial map of Vancouver and you'll see the huge patch of green dominating the downtown peninsula. This green patch is Stanley Park Vancouver, the gem of the city that makes Vancouver what it is. The park is nearly 1000 acres in size, reflecting the city's love for nature and appreciation for preserving green spaces, even in such a quickly-growing area.unner statue of Harry Jerome (Canadian Olympian three times: 1960, 1964 and 1968) in Stanley ParkStanley Park is the largest urban park in North America, and opposed to other famous North American parks such as Central Park in New York, Stanley Park Vancouver is not just a manicured sprawl of lawns and neatly planted trees. What makes Stanley Park unique are the amazing views on the wrap-around Stanley Park seawall, the dense rainforests, the marshland, and the beaches.Stanley Park mapThe Stanley Park seawall follows the park along the Oceanside with bike and pedestrian pathways. Every day joggers, bikers, rollerbladers, walkers and others out to enjoy the view can follow the Stanley Park seawall for 10.5 km along the beach. Away from the seawall and the perimeter of the park, a dense forest grows, where few people actually spend much time. Like other parks, there are also plenty of lawn areas to play soccer or toss a Frisbee, and a number of beaches for sunbathing and volleyball. On this beautiful and sunny September's Sunday, when the temperature was reaching almost 30 degrees, park was really crowded and people were everywhere. We drove around the park as it was difficult to find parking. It was still enjoyable...Lions Gate Bridge viewed from Stanley ParkFamilies enjoying the bike ride in the parkStanley Park history begins in the early stages of the city's development. In 1886 the city council made the insightful decision to turn what had become a military reserve into a park. The towering cedars, swamp lands (now known as Lost Lagoon), and prime water-front property were all set aside for the ""use and enjoyment of people of all colors, creeds and customs for all time,"" according to Lord Stanley, Canada's governor general from1888 to 1893. Stanley Park history set the tone for the way the city would evolve; deeply committed to the preservation of its natural resources.To best enjoy Stanley Park, try renting a bicycle at one of the many bike rental stores along the way. To walk the entire Stanley Park seawall it takes about two hours at a brisk pace, so don't expect to be able to breeze through the park in a few minutes. Besides, there is so much to do and see in the park, you'll want to take your time.There are a number of restaurants in Stanley Park where you can enjoy a delicious meal with a stunning view. Try afternoon tea at the Rose Garden or lunch at the scenic Sequoia Grill (formerly the Stanley Park Teahouse). The Fish House has delicious seafood in a beautiful heritage house. At the Prospect Point viewpoint there is a nice cafe. While touring around the park, make a stop at the totem poles, and plan some time to see the Vancouver Aquarium.View on downtown Vancouver from Stanley ParkIf you decide to tackle Stanley Park Vancouver on foot, the Translink bus system can make the distance between attractions much quicker. Look for the ''Stanley Park Shuttle'' which runs on a fifteen-minute schedule daily from June through August. The bus makes fourteen stops around the park.Cruise ship docked in Vancouver PortCruising Port Metro VancouverAfter visiting Stanley Park, we found parking at the Vancouver Convention Centre. From there everything we planed to see was on a walking distance. For more than 30 years, the Port Metro Vancouver has been a leading homeport for Alaska cruises. The Port's two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, are conveniently located and only 30 minutes away from the Vancouver International Airport. Canada Place is located in the city centre, close to shopping, dining, attractions, and Stanley Park. Ballantyne is located east of the city centre and close to Canada Place. The cruise terminals are modern, secure, and world-class.Port Metro VancouverThe Port welcomed 199 ship visits and more than 663,000 revenue passengers at its two cruise terminals, Canada Place and Ballantyne, which offer all the modern conveniences and services for a positive and safe cruise experience.The Capitan... my Captain!!Canada PlacePort Metro Vancouver's premier cruise facility is located in the city centre, at 999 Canada Place near excellent hotels, shopping, dining, entertainment and attractions. Its distinctive white sail design, five-star hotel, and the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition Centre make Canada Place an attractive start and finish to any cruise experience. When we walked through the Convention Centre, Aritzia clothing company, was having a 'only once a year' warehouse sale and swarms of shoppers hit this warehouse sale and were walking around with the Aritzia begs...Canada Place in VancouverBallantyneBallantyne, Port Metro Vancouver's second cruise facility, is located at 851 Centennial Road, east of the city centre and just minutes away from Canada Place. The entire terminal underwent a major expansion and renovation in 1995, ensuring modern and efficient services to the cruise industry.Travellers to Ballantyne have access to Ballantyne Cruise Terminal via Clark Drive or McGill Street Overpass only. There is no access to travelers via Victoria Drive and Heatley Avenue.Historic GastownGateway to historic GastownAfter visiting port of Vancouver, we walked several blocks to Gastown. Gastown is where Vancouver originated from. The original part of Vancouver - Gastown - came about in 1867 after a man named ""Gassy Jack"". Deighton opened up a saloon near a lumber mill in the area.Today Gastown itself is a cobble stoned regenerated area with shops as disparate as vintage outlets to the more tourist orientated stores. It's also home to the world's first steam powered clock, which can still be seen working to this day. It also has some great bars for a night out such as the Lamplighter, the Cork and Fin and the Salt Tasting Room.The most touristy spot is by this steam-powered clockBusy Gastown street with globe-shaped street lampsThe old-world charm of Gastown sits in the middle of the modern city of Vancouver. Gastown is recognized by its cobblestone roads and globe-shaped street lamps. This place has an interesting mix of historical sites, modern upscale housing, souvenir shops, art galleries, restaurants, boutiques and professional offices. Today Gastown has been designated as a heritage site.Busy streets in Gastown areaThere is a landmark in Gastown that is hard to miss. It is a steam-powered clock that sits on the corner of Cambie and Water Street. In 1977, Ray Saunders, a Canadian horologist, was commissioned by the city of Vancouver to build the steam clock to cover a steam grate. It was an honour to be able to have Ray showing me how the clock works. Today, the steam clock attracts thousands of visitors waiting to hear the whistle blow every quarter of an hour. It is also one of the most photographed landmarks in the city.Gastown HistoryEstablished the same year that Canada became a nation, Gastown grew into Canada's third largest city and one of its most cosmopolitan. But the Gastown district today retains its historic charm, independent spirit and distinctiveness. There's no mistaking Gastown for any other area of Vancouver, or of Canada for that matter.1867: The south shore of Burrard Inlet was a wilderness. Its only non-native settlement was a lumber mill where the owner didn't allow alcohol on the premises.One September day, ""Gassy Jack"" Deighton arrived (he received his nickname because of his penchant for spinning tall tales and talking without end). He stepped ashore with a barrel of whiskey, telling the millworkers that if they'd build him a saloon, he'd serve them drinks. The saloon was up and running within a day...just across the property line of the mill. Gastown was born.1870: On March 1st, in order to give it a more distinguished name, Gastown was officially proclaimed to be ""Granville"", after the British colonial secretary. But everybody in the rough and tumble settlement continued to call it Gastown.1886: Gastown was incorporated as the City of Vancouver, after British explorer, George Vancouver. That was April 6th. On June 13th, a brush-clearing fire got out of control and turned all but two of Vancouver's 400 buildings to ashes.1920s: Gastown grew and prospered, as did the rest of the City of Vancouver. But good times couldn't last forever.Depression Years: Gastown fell on hard times and deteriorated into a stereotypical skid road area until the 1960s.1960s: With talk of demolishing the area becoming more widespread, a group of dedicated citizens took it upon themselves to save Gastown's distinctive architecture and character. The city rallied around them. Gastown was not just saved, it was reborn.1971: The provincial government declared Gastown an historic area, protecting its heritage buildings.This steam-powered clock sits on the corner of Cambie and Water StreetToday: Gastown is a refreshing mix of old and new, downhome and upscale, a place for tourists, Vancouver residents and office workers alike. Various shops have the streets buzzing during the day. A host of restaurants and nightspots keeps the area humming into the wee hours. And, more and more, Gastown is becoming home to permanent residents... just like in the old days.Gastown WebsiteWater St. CafeWater St. CafeGastown seems to be a perfect place to rest our tired touristy feet and find a place to sit and have a lunch. We picked the restaurant which is just across from the 'Steam Clock', at the intersection of Water Street and Cambie Street. We had no reservations but were lucky to get a table inside, with direct view of the famous Steam Clock. The Steam Clock is a big tourist attraction and it was interesting to watch other tourists stop at the Steam Clock to listen to the tunes the Clock plays on the quarter hour.We had good times at the Water St. CafeThe food at The Water Street Cafe was excellent. Our friends had the New York steak sandwich, my wife had the Forno Roasted chicken salad and I had Linguine Pesto with chicken pasta. Both were prepared to perfection. Service was a little slow but they were really busy. Highly recommended restaurant on a perfect spot.After lunch we walked down the Water Street. We're in tourist territory here - right next to the steam clock - so you're not going to find any bargain prices. But what you do want is some friendly service from people who seem like they care, and some decent food. This is what you get! There is also a good atmosphere which you won't always get in these sorts of locations. Noticed several homeless people laying on the sidewalks... not a great picture especially for this touristy area!Best place to liveIt is impossible to see more that what we did in only two days. We used our time to the max and really like it. There are endless things to do in Vancouver. You can enjoy the beautiful scenery and nature or explore all that the city has to offer you. If you ever feel like you need a change of pace, you can always find something new to do.Vancouver scenic viewsWith its scenic views, mild climate, and friendly people, Vancouver is known around the world as one of the best places to live and is a popular tourist attraction. Vancouver is also one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada with 52% of the population speaking a first language other than English.Vancouver has been host to many international conferences and events, including the 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics.I would like to thank our hosts for their hospitality. In return I hope they enjoyed this two days tour of Vancouver with us as much as we did!

Lots of fancy cars and high end stores. The water and the green peeking out in the background. We felt safe walking day and night. It is remarkable the vision for this city. They rejected having a highway bisecting their city so that is why there is none in the heart of the city. Also, early on they encouraged vertical development so the city stayed fairly compact and they did not eat up prized properties such as Stanley Park.

4591,Beautiful But Lacking in Personality,,"Alright. I was in Vancouver for one week and walked 70 miles and covered every area recommended by the locals. First let me say this:Vancouver is a very beautiful city with top tier everything (which is why it is the most expensive city in North America and rated as one of the best cities to live in, in the world). The public transit is state of the art. The urban planning and walkability is among the best in the world. The architecture, while modern, is excellent. The parks are beautiful with lots of outdoor activities available. The city is safe and clean, and a very tolerant multicultural melting pot, very mixed everywhere(it's not segregated like other cities). This is perhaps its greatest strength...but it is also perhaps its greatest weakness as well.I really wanted to love Vancouver but I couldn't. The reason for this, is that despite having everything listed above, I felt it lacked a culture or ideas that are unique to Vancouver. It did not even feel like a Canadian city to me (I have been to the other big two) and I felt that if someone blindfolded me and dropped me off in Vancouver, I would have no idea what city I am in. It felt like a West Coast American City (except with the Canadian hospitality) or a large Asia Pacific City.When you go to Montreal, you get the feel for the French Canadians by language, architecture, poutine, Montreal smoked beef etc.When you go to Toronto, you feel like you are in Canada with buildings such as the Hockey Hall of Fame, CN Tower, CBC, Eaton Center, etc. It feels Canadian.With Vancouver, there was not anything I could really point to that is a product of Vancouver and I think that is due to the lack of any one culture having a dominating influence, which is why I said its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness.With all that said, having been to many cities Vancouver is up there and would be a 5-star city if it had that identity I was looking for.A few cons: - Seems drug use is tolerated so you may get random whiffs of pot while walking- Some random whiffs of urine (more-so than other large cities I have visited or lived in)- Many bums/pan-handlers - more than Chicago which caught me by surprise","September 7, 2012",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 18:54:41.036825,2021-06-18 18:54:41.115757,"The city is safe and clean, and a very tolerant multicultural melting pot, very mixed","is safe and clean, and a very tolerant multicultural melting pot, very mixed",0.9841264486312866,safety,safe

2160,So it's a cobbled street .......,,"Having read numerous previous reviews before I went, I found it a bit disappointing. Several reviewers had enthused that it's just like Europe - seemingly because the ""main street"" is cobbled. Well, yes it is, but Europe is more than just cobbled streets. Europe usually also offers narrow passageways, lots of hanging baskets/window boxes filled with flowers and outdoor cafe. Gastown has none of these - unless it's completely different in the summer than it is in January. It has a high percentage of tourist/souvenir shops, so if that's what you're looking for, then this is the place to come. Other reviews said Hudson House Trading Company is the best place for souvenirs, and although it's probably the largest, I didn't think it was necessarily the best. There's another souvenir shop on the same side of the street as Hudson House, but further away from the Steam Clock. Think it was called Smileys. They had the same souvenirs but at better prices. The most famous part of Gastown is of course the Steam Clock, which is on a corner just past Hudson House. The steam is continuous but the clock only chimes on the hour.

The rest of Gastown is a haven for the down-and-out, so be prepared for a look at the seedy underside of Vancouver if you wander too far into the Gastown district. You can expect to be accosted by drug dealers, even in daylight, and the ever present homeless looking for handouts. I prefer to give my donations to agencies who help the homeless, so it was somewhat uncomfortable. They mostly stick to the shadows in the daylight, but it gets pretty rough after dark. I never felt unsafe, but we were there in daylight and my husband casts a rather large shadow. There is a sign for public washrooms. DON'T GO THERE! It is one of those self-cleaning washrooms in a square filled with junkies and alcoholics. If you want to avoid more evidence of the pervasive drug (and alcohol) culture in the area, and the worst of the graffiti, avoid Hastings and Main.If it is shopping and restaurants you are looking for, head over to the Public Market on Granville Island.","June 23, 2013",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-18 20:35:31.482582,2021-06-18 20:35:31.566033,"I never felt unsafe, but we were there in daylight and my husband casts a rather large shadow.",I never felt unsafe,0.9958433508872986,safety,unsafe

4384,"Gastown, Vancouver, BC",,"Having arrived in Vancouver early for a Celebrity Century cruise I decided to spend a half day seeing what I could of Vancouver. Gastown is a short 10 minute walk from the cruise docking site at the Olympic flags area. Turn left as you exit the ship and walk along safe streets to Gastown. Gastown is really only about two blocks wide and is the oldest remaining section of town. The older buildings some Victorian give it a quaint feel. Gas Jack the steam driven clock which chimes the Westminster chimes every 15 minutes adds to the ambience. Some 1rst Nation culture can be seen, as well as, native art galleries and shops. If you want to buy souvenirs there some inexpensive shops with a wide variety of goods in Gastown. Upscale to casual dining is plentiful. The Old Spaghetti Factory is a favorite to some. From Gastown it is a short walk to Chinatown but you need to walk through a pretty rough section with homeless and vagrants all about. If you want to go to chinatown the better solution is take the translink from the waterfront area.

0,A Stroll Through Trendy Yaletown,,"I don't tend to patronize Yaletown very often, which is kind of funny given the hotel I usually stay at is just a couple blocks away. Why is that, I wonder? I consider myself a foodie and history buff; thus, you'd think Yaletown would be a regular haunt of mine; however, it's rarely on the itinerary whenever I'm in the city. Maybe I'll have to work at changing that? After all, this neighbourhood is rife with history and remains home to some of Vancouver's best restaurants. How could one resist that?From a geographic perspective, Yaletown is typically framed as being east of Homer Street, between Robson Street and False Creek (see my earlier reviews of both on this site). In that respect, Yaletown is a fairly compact neighbourhood, though it is quite densely populated thanks to the new-ish high rise towers along the waterfront. These rather pricey living spaces have unfortunately resulted in The Travel tagging Yaletown as ""safe [but] snobby,"" which I don't think is a fair characterization because the neighbourhood certainly is NOT ""snobby."" It's chic and a little up-scale, yes, but remains just as friendly as other areas of Vancouver.One of the most significant things I appreciate about Yaletown is its history. In its infancy, it was primarily a warehouse district and shipping area for trains; in fact, it was once the Western terminus for the CP Railway. In the early 20th century, when rail started giving way to trucking, Yaletown remained in a sort of stasis until Expo '86 arrived. When Vancouver played host to the World's Fair, the waterfront along False Creek - including sections of Yaletown - housed many of the venues for this historic event. The Expo, then, not only improved Vancouver's profile, but also provided the impetus for redeveloping and reimagining Yaletown.Indeed, it wasn't long after the Expo concluded that Yaletown began to see something of resurgence. Many of the warehouses and brick edifices were transformed and re-purposed into office space, residential lofts, cafes and boutique shops. The restaurants, in particular, highlight this wonderful synthesis of the classic and the modern: Most are situated in redbrick warehouses that were built with exterior platforms originally used to load and unload trains. In the current day, these platforms now function as year-round patios. Personally, I love it when we can incorporate our history into the present so seamlessly!Speaking of restaurants, as already noted, Yaletown is home to some of Vancouver's best:* Blue Water Cafe (Was ranked #1 on TripAdvisor for the longest time, but still remains in the top 10. It's also on my restaurant bucket list!)* Bistro Sakana (An excellent sushi restaurant that specializes in aburi sushi. Very close in quality to Miku!)* Cactus Club (Vancouver-based chain that needs no introduction. They have locations all over the place and are consistent across the board . . . also home to some of the most beautiful servers ;) haha. Some of you may get that reference)* Grand Chinese Yaletown (Home to some great casual, and slightly upscale eats)* The Keg (classic steakhouse)* OEB Breakfast Company (Originating in Alberta, OEB is known for their unique breakfast/brunch options. Lobster crepe, anyone?)* Bake49 (The double fromage cheesecake takes dessert to a whole new level!)There are a whole host of others, of course, so do take the time to amble about Yaletown before making your gastronomical selection!Beyond restaurants, Yaletown does offer a number of recreational activities. One could spend hours tootling about the brick walkways and taking pictures of the heritage structures, for example. Then there are also the boutique shops, which attract many. Or, if you want to escape the cityscape, Yaletown is also home to George Wainborn Park and David Lam Park, both of which run along the ever-popular Seawall, and provide lovely views of False Creek.Heritage meets modern, indeed. As I write these words, I feel inspired to visit this area more often. The living heritage is cool, but the restaurants are most enticing! Now, do yourself a favour and check out this ""chic"" neighbourhood and enjoy!","June 16, 2021",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-18 21:02:47.978390,2021-06-18 21:02:48.086085,"These rather pricey living spaces have unfortunately resulted in The Travel tagging Yaletown as ""safe [but] snobby,"" which I don't think is a fair characterization because the neighbourhood certainly is NOT ""snobby.","have unfortunately resulted in The Travel tagging Yaletown as ""safe [but] snobby,"" which I don't think is a fair characterization because the neighbourhood certainly is NOT ""snobby",-0.9887139201164246,safety,safe

It's best to stay on the main drag at night as there is a local youth gang which hangs out around the Skytrain Station at Broadway and Commercial, at the park 3 blocks North of First St, and in the neighborhood behind (West of) the park. When you reach Venables St, it's all bad on both sides down to the harbor and it's all residential so there is nothing to see or buy. Here are government subsidized projects and cheap housing where conditions exist which promotes restless kids and desperate acts. On Commercial itself you will find a harmonious and eclectic mixture of immigrant cultures offering everything from soup to nuts. There are stores of all kinds and extractions, restaurants, some notable but most not, cafes, boutiques, specialty shops, hippie food, services of all kinds, a regular Canadian neighborhood bar along with a dozen other fancy and semi fancy ""public alcohol dispensaries"", and a couple of legal marijuana ones, art galleries, fast foods galore, 2 pool halls, one fancy movie theater on Broadway at Commercial and anything else you might think of including an Italian Armory.

I am not sure if we wandered through a needle-exchange zone or what, but there were about 100 people from all walks of life concentrated on a small street corner and it was clear that these folks did not feel well. No violence, no threats, just a feeling of uneasiness. Caught this family of four (with 2 young kids) off guard. Would have appreciated some sort of ""warning"" I guess. Spent the next two hours explaining to my kids what we had just wandered through. The walk to Chinatown was not really worth it in hindsight.

However, the locals who aren't Chinese try to avoid this area as much as possible. China town itself has some cool stuff, but it's really a pity that it infiltrated and surrounded by the worst sort of people you can imagine. High crime and massive drugs abound.

Stay between the edge of hastings and the park by Keefer street and you'll be fine. Then it's great. Many interesting shops, the garden is great and a nice mixture of city views and Chinese vibes. Check out the spice stores and your senses will explode :) Keefer bar is nice for drinks afterwards. Try acme cafe for a great lunch!If you ever feel like you are in a weird area and it's losing the Asian charm, feel free to ask some locals for the way. Ps.

I brushed off his advice and decided that he just couldn't be correct.Today, we walked from our hotel near Stanley Park east down Pender which leads directly through the Chinatown arch. We immediately noticed how run-down the area is: so many open storefronts, litter all over the streets, homeless people...not just homeless but crazy doped-up people. Walking along, we smelled pot numerous times but worst of all we noticed a guy with a lighter, spoon, and needle...maybe crack or heroin? Also, you'll frequently smell the sweet fragrance of public urination.It was around lunchtime and we expected to find some good restaurants. Can you believe that there are no more than six or seven restaurants...not a one with a decent menu and all requiring cash payments only. We were so disappointed and my wife (born in Chongqing and worked in Dongguan) was literally scared and disgusted.

331,Devolution but still good,,"Vancouver's Chinatown is the second largest in North America, after San Francisco's iconic neighborhood comprised by those with Chinese ancestry. I had the good fortune to visit Vancouver 18 years ago, in 1997. The phenomenal growth throughout the rest of downtown in almost two decades astounded me. Skyscrapers next to English Bay remind me of Hong Kong. Visiting Chinatown was an easy walk from the Granville Street hotel. But that growth seems to have caused a demographic shift. Chinatown property owners resisted skyscraper development choosing instead to keep things the way they have been for decades: small buildings adjacent to sidewalks that border streets. Lack of development may have attracted the homeless and drug addicted population, though I saw that sad aspect only on side streets. I advise enjoying Chinatown sights only on Main Street. Use the same sensibilities you would in any large city's borderline community. NEVER wear gobs of jewelry and flash cash when traveling. Do you really need to impress anyone with a dozen credit cards or Rolex watch? A safety suggestion for any large city: If you feel threatened, walk into the street while checking for traffic. I did this on New York's Park Avenue one evening.Our 39-member tour group of mostly elderly people (meaning we felt safe and were not bothered) had several stops in Chinatown during our 3-day stay in Vancouver, Chinatown's Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden included. That Zen-like garden and the history we learned about how Chinese immigrants were instrumental to the development of the West Coast of Canada and America made me realize the mega cities lining the Pacific Ocean would not have occurred otherwise. Our tour included lunch at Jade Dynasty restaurant. I highly recommend the Dim Sum at Jade Dynasty. It was in Chinatown 18 years ago that I came across an idea: Use porcelain chopstick rests to place knives at a more formal dinner. I give a set of these to hosts when invited to dinner. Each host has appreciated the idea, and the tablecloth isn't stained.","October 10, 2015",0,0,,4.0,2021-06-19 08:15:06.127748,2021-06-19 08:15:06.215388,"Our 39-member tour group of mostly elderly people (meaning we felt safe and were not bothered) had several stops in Chinatown during our 3-day stay in Vancouver, Chinatown's Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden included.",Our 39-member tour group of mostly elderly people (meaning we felt safe and were not bothered),0.9928663969039917,safety,safe

627,Avoid,,"I consider myself to be a very seasoned traveler and very comfortable in most situations. I went to Vancouver several years ago (2001) and wanted to see Chinatown. We drove into the area and decided not to stay. At this time, the area was overrun by homeless and drug addicts. At one pt, I honestly wondered if we were in some type of leper colony. We witnessed drug deals and people shooting up drugs just driving through in our car so I can't imagine walking around in the area and feeling safe. It was a truly sad and heart breaking experience and I would personally encourage people to avoid this area.","January 12, 2012",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:16.033992,2021-06-19 08:20:16.168177,so I can't imagine walking around in the area and feeling safe.,can't imagine walking around in the area and feeling safe,0.9653795957565308,safety,safe
640,TERRIBLE AND HORRFYING EXPERIENCE,,"It was my very first time to visit Vancouver, Canada and was so excited. Though my husband has gone there before, he suggested that we all all first go to Chinatown to buy our favorite local fruit back home called lanzones, so we can bring it to the park. It was almost 11:00am and we parked at this ""they say safe parking lot"". At around 1:00pm we went back to the parking lot and was horrified to find out that our van got broken into. The police where even about to tow our van had we not returned immediately. I can not even imagine having this happened in broad day light and all they can say is ""I am sorry this has happened"". The worst part is cleaning the mess and had to go back to Seattle right after the incident with some kind of vinyl that covered our back seat window travelling at 60 mph. Though the ""bad guys"" did not get anything except for a bag with clothes, the inconvenience, stress and spoiling the fun made me think of not ever going back to Chinatown in Vancouver, Canada.","September 23, 2011",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:39.572048,2021-06-19 08:20:39.665696,"""they say safe parking lot"".",say safe parking lot,0.8752257227897644,safety,safe
645,"Just a few hours ago, my wife and I...",,"Just a few hours ago, my wife and I walked here from our hotel based on all the guidebooks' suggestions. But we quickly discovered that the guidebooks are wrong. The area has cultural significance, true, but it also has some of the most aggressive panhandling we've ever experienced. Further, garbage and newspapers littered the sides of the streets which is unlike any part of Vancouver we have seen yet downtown. Like other posters here, we're neither prudish nor untraveled. We never encounter problems when we're traveling abroad. Not true here. We wanted to see one of the gardens, but the panhandling was so severe and openly threatening that it just wasn't safe to venture off the main roads. Unfortunately, we'll not be going back to Chinatown and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My sense is that this is area needs some heavy policing and more involvement from the broader Vancouver governance.For now, please, don't go to Chinatown. The city needs to stop promoting it altogether as a worthwhile place to visit until these problems are handled.","July 25, 2010",0,0,,1.0,2021-06-19 08:20:40.058923,2021-06-19 08:20:40.163895,"We wanted to see one of the gardens, but the panhandling was so severe and openly threatening that it just wasn't safe to venture off the main roads.",the panhandling was so severe and openly threatening that it just wasn't safe to venture off the main roads,-0.9997401833534241,safety,safe
653,Best seen in the morning or afternoon,,"As a local, I'm always amazed at the amount of visitors to Vancouver who seem to know nothing much about the city, except that it has a Chinatown. And while that's fantastic that people are interested in Vancouver's Chinatown, there are certain things that they should know before they plan to visitMarketing campaigns and tourism literature have promoted Vancouver's Chinatown as being one of North America's largest. In other North American cities, Chinatowns are often dolled-up boutique shopping districts, or they're vibrant neighbourhoods offering the city's best Chinese food. This is not the case in Vancouver.Vancouver's Chinatown is one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the city. It's the face of Vancouver's first Chinese immigrants from the 1800's and it was here where they set up shop in the young city. As a result, Chinatown's a fantastic place if you're interested in Vancouver's early architecture. It's also a great place if you're looking for the more traditional Chinese culture. If you're looking for contemporary Chinese culture which is found elsewhere in Greater Vancouver, you will not find it as much in Chinatown. Vancouver's Chinatown also has a bit of a gritty edge to it. It exists because of its history, not for the sake of tourists. This can either add to the charm, or take away from it, depending on your expectations. It's a neat place to visit in the morning or afternoon as this is when the shops are open. There aren't that many fashion boutiques, but moreso the traditional Chinese markets, such as traditional Chinese medicine shops, Chinese kitchen supply shops, fresh produce shops, butcher shops selling BBQ duck in the window, dried good shops (like dried shrimp, fish, roots, and mushrooms in baskets on the sidewalk), bakeries selling almond cakes and BBQ pork buns, live seafood shops, and even the occasional ornamental shops, selling Oriental vases, statues, paper kites, etc. These shops are located along Pender Street, Main Street, and Keefer Street. Another attraction in Chinatown is the Dr. Sun Yat Sens Gardens - small, but beautiful classical Chinese gardens. The Chinese Cultural Centre is located here as well. While there are certainly Chinese restaurants in Vancouver's Chinatown, there are actually not as many as you may imagine. Because Vancouver's Chinese community are not confined to Chinatown, there are actually more Chinese restaurants outside of Chinatown than within. The best Chinese restaurants are scattered all over Vancouver, with only one or two located in Chinatown. Floata and Hon's spring to mind. In the evening, the shops in Chinatown are closed, and as a result, feels a bit like a ghost town. Even neighbouring Gastown feels like this and I would not recommend visiting either at this time. It's not that it's unsafe, it's just that it be rather unpleasant, especially if this is your first time in Vancouver's Chinatown. One block over from Chinatown is a very run down part of Vancouver, and some of that ambiance spills over into Chinatown (and Gastown) at night. However, in the summertime, Chinatown hosts its annual night market on Keefer Street on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings. It's a small, traditional night market, but if you're in the area, it's worth visiting. This is really the only time of the year when Chinatown is nice to visit at night. While walking into Chinatown, the nicest way to get there is to walk W Pender, and not Hastings Street. Hastings is only one block north of Chinatown, but it's run down in that part and there would be nothing really to see on it anyway. The intersection of Main Street and Hastings is home to a large conglomerate of junkies, which can make a stroll to that intersection a bit unnerving. Hastings is a large street otherwise and is completely fine elsewhere in the city.Another way to get to Chinatown is to take the skytrain to the ""Stadium-Chinatown"" station as you'd only be a short walk away from the main gates at Pender Street.You do not need half a day to see Chinatown - only a few hours will do. While I would not recommend visiting Chinatown for either a vibrant Chinese dining scene, an evening destination, or a contemporary shopping spree, if you appreciate architecture, traditional Chinese culture, and history, then it's certainly worth a look.","August 27, 2006",0,0,,3.0,2021-06-19 08:20:50.920089,2021-06-19 08:20:51.009212,"It's not that it's unsafe, it's just that it be rather unpleasant, especially if this is your first time in Vancouver's Chinatown.",It's not that it's unsafe,-0.9999266862869263,safety,unsafe
